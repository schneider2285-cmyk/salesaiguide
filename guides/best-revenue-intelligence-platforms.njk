<div class="guide-main-content">

<p class="guide-intro">Revenue intelligence platforms turn pipeline data into actionable forecasts by analyzing CRM activity, conversation signals, and engagement patterns. In 2026, the best tools combine AI-powered forecasting with deal inspection and call intelligence &mdash; replacing the gut-feel forecasting that still plagues most sales orgs. We tested 6 platforms on forecasting accuracy, CRM integration depth, and actual value delivered to sales managers.</p>

<p>The bottom line: <strong>revenue intelligence works best when it sits on top of clean CRM data and consistent rep behavior.</strong> The tools that deliver real forecast accuracy are the ones that capture signals automatically &mdash; not the ones that ask reps to manually update deal stages.</p>

      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Clari</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">The most trusted pipeline forecasting platform for enterprise sales</p>
    </div>
    <div class="guide-tool-cta">

  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Clari is the category leader for revenue forecasting. It ingests CRM data, email activity, calendar events, and call recordings to build AI-powered pipeline predictions that sales leaders use for weekly forecast calls. The core value proposition: Clari tells you which deals will close, which are at risk, and where your forecast is soft &mdash; without relying on rep self-reporting.</p>
    <p><strong>Why #1:</strong> Forecasting accuracy is Clari's entire focus, and it shows. Based on G2 reviews, teams using Clari report 15-30% improvement in forecast accuracy within the first two quarters. The Copilot feature now captures call recordings and auto-updates CRM, reducing the manual data hygiene that plagued earlier versions. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Enterprise-only pricing (typically $50&ndash;100/seat/month) and a 2&ndash;4 week implementation cycle. Not practical for teams under 20 reps.</p>

      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Gong</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Conversation intelligence that doubles as revenue intelligence</p>
    </div>
    <div class="guide-tool-cta">
      <a href="/go/gong" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Visit Gong &#8599;</a>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Gong built its reputation on call recording and coaching, but the Revenue Intelligence layer has become equally important. Gong analyzes every customer interaction &mdash; calls, emails, meetings &mdash; to surface deal risks, forecast gaps, and pipeline health signals. The advantage over Clari: Gong's signals come from actual conversations, not just CRM data. When a champion goes quiet or a competitor is mentioned, Gong catches it.</p>
    <p><strong>Why #2:</strong> The highest Org Score (78) in our dataset, reflecting deep enterprise capabilities and the richest conversation data available. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Higher price point (typically $1,200&ndash;$1,600/user/year). If you only need forecasting and already have clean CRM data, Clari is more focused. Gong's strength is combining call intelligence with revenue signals.</p>

    <div class="guide-tool-cta">
      <a href="/go/salesloft" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Visit Salesloft &#8599;</a>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Salesloft has evolved from a pure sales engagement platform into a revenue workflow tool. The Forecast module uses deal signals from cadence activity, email engagement, and call recordings to generate pipeline predictions. The advantage: engagement data and forecasting live in one platform, so managers see which sequences are working and which deals need attention from a single dashboard.</p>
    <p><strong>Why #3:</strong> The strongest option for teams that want engagement + forecasting without buying two separate platforms. The Coaching module is better than Outreach's equivalent. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Forecasting depth is shallower than Clari's &mdash; it works well for mid-market teams but enterprise orgs with complex org structures may need a dedicated forecasting tool alongside Salesloft.</p>

    <div class="guide-tool-cta">
      <a href="/go/outreach" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Visit Outreach &#8599;</a>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Outreach is the most widely deployed sales engagement platform for enterprise teams, and its revenue intelligence features have been growing steadily. Kaia AI provides real-time call assistance, and the Commit module handles pipeline forecasting and deal inspection. The depth of Salesforce integration makes it a natural choice for orgs already invested in the Salesforce ecosystem.</p>
    <p><strong>Why #4:</strong> The largest install base and the deepest enterprise integrations of any engagement platform. The Commit forecasting module is solid for teams already on Outreach. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Revenue intelligence is an add-on, not the core product. If you're buying Outreach specifically for forecasting, Clari or Gong will give you deeper insights. Outreach shines when you need engagement + pipeline visibility as a bundle.</p>

    <div class="guide-tool-cta">
      <a href="/go/boostup" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Visit Boostup &#8599;</a>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Boostup positions itself as the most customizable revenue intelligence platform. Its deal inspection module lets RevOps teams build custom scoring models, risk signals, and forecast categories. Where Clari provides opinionated out-of-the-box forecasting, Boostup lets you define what "at risk" means for your specific business. The tradeoff: more setup time, but more accurate forecasts once configured.</p>
    <p><strong>Why #5:</strong> The best option for RevOps teams that want to build custom forecasting models rather than using off-the-shelf predictions. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Smaller market presence than Clari or Gong means fewer reviews, a smaller partner ecosystem, and more dependence on the vendor's customer success team. Not the right choice if you want fast time-to-value.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Aviso takes the most aggressive AI-first approach of any revenue intelligence vendor. Its WinScore AI predicts deal outcomes based on historical patterns, buyer engagement signals, and competitive intelligence. The platform also includes conversation intelligence and guided selling features, making it a potential one-stop-shop for revenue teams that want AI-powered everything.</p>
    <p><strong>Why #6:</strong> The most AI-forward approach to revenue intelligence, with predictive deal scoring that improves over time. <strong>Limitation:</strong> Smallest install base of the six, which means less community knowledge, fewer integrations, and more vendor dependency. The AI accuracy claims are hard to independently verify given the limited public review data. Best for teams that are comfortable being early adopters.</p>

<h2>How to Choose</h2>

<p>The right revenue intelligence platform depends on what you already have and what problem you are solving:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You need better forecasts and already have Gong:</strong> Gong's Revenue Intelligence layer may be enough &mdash; no need for a second tool.</li>
  <li><strong>You need forecasting + call coaching and have neither:</strong> Gong gives you both in one. Clari + a separate call tool costs more.</li>
  <li><strong>You need pure forecasting accuracy and have clean CRM data:</strong> Clari is the focused choice. It does one thing better than anyone.</li>
  <li><strong>You want engagement + pipeline in one platform:</strong> Salesloft (mid-market) or Outreach (enterprise) with their built-in forecast modules.</li>
  <li><strong>You need custom forecasting models:</strong> Boostup gives RevOps teams the most control.</li>
  <li><strong>You want to bet on AI-native:</strong> Aviso is the most aggressive AI-first approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Do I need revenue intelligence if I already have a CRM?</h3>
<p>CRM data alone does not forecast accurately because it depends on reps manually updating deal stages. Revenue intelligence tools capture signals automatically &mdash; email opens, call sentiment, meeting frequency &mdash; and use them to predict outcomes independently of rep self-reporting. Based on G2 reviews, teams using revenue intelligence alongside their CRM see 15-30% improvement in forecast accuracy.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between Gong and Clari?</h3>
<p>Gong started as conversation intelligence (call recording + coaching) and expanded into revenue forecasting. Clari started as a forecasting platform. Gong's revenue signals come from conversation data; Clari's come from CRM + activity data. If you need both call coaching and forecasting, Gong is the better all-in-one. If you only need forecasting, Clari is more focused.</p>

<h3>Are revenue intelligence tools worth the cost for small teams?</h3>
<p>Most revenue intelligence platforms are enterprise-priced ($50&ndash;130/seat/month) and require CRM integration setup. For teams under 20 reps, the ROI is harder to justify. Better options for smaller teams: HubSpot Sales Hub Pro ($100/seat/month) includes basic forecasting, or use Gong's Essential tier if call coaching is the primary need.</p>
