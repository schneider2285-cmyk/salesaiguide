Chorus (4.5/5 on G2) is now part of ZoomInfo, which means it integrates deeply with ZoomInfo's contact data and intent signals. If you already use ZoomInfo, Chorus is the natural fit. If you want the strongest standalone conversation intelligence, Gong is the market leader."

It fills the gap between what your CRM says about a deal and what's actually being discussed. For teams with 5+ reps running discovery and demo calls, it typically pays for itself through improved coaching and deal visibility."

                        <h2>Introduction: What Conversation Intelligence Does</h2>
                        <p>Conversation intelligence is one of the most impactful categories in the modern sales stack. These platforms automatically record, transcribe, and analyze sales calls and meetings, then surface AI-driven insights that help managers coach reps and leadership forecast revenue more accurately. At its core, conversation intelligence solves a fundamental problem: sales managers cannot sit in on every call, and CRM data only reflects what reps choose to log.</p>
                        <p>The technology works by joining Zoom, Teams, or Google Meet calls as a participant, recording the audio, generating a real-time transcript, and then applying natural language processing to extract meaningful signals. These signals include talk-to-listen ratios (the best reps typically listen more than they talk), competitor mentions, pricing objections, next-step commitments, and buyer engagement patterns.</p>
                        <p>For sales managers, this means they can review any call in minutes instead of sitting through the full recording. AI highlights the key moments: when the prospect expressed concern, when budget was discussed, when a competitor was mentioned. Managers can leave timestamped coaching comments, create libraries of winning call snippets for new hire training, and track whether reps are following the sales methodology consistently.</p>
                        <p>For revenue leadership, conversation intelligence provides a layer of deal visibility that pipeline stages and probability fields cannot match. When a rep marks a deal as 70% probability in the CRM, conversation intelligence can show whether the buyer actually expressed purchase intent, whether key stakeholders were present on recent calls, and whether next steps were clearly agreed upon. This is why the category has become central to modern revenue forecasting.</p>
                        <p>The market is dominated by three platforms: Gong (the standalone market leader), Chorus (now part of ZoomInfo's platform), and Clari (which blends conversation intelligence with revenue forecasting). All three use custom pricing, typically ranging from $100-$200+ per user per month with annual contracts. This makes conversation intelligence a significant investment, but for teams running consistent discovery and demo calls, the coaching and forecasting improvements typically justify the cost.</p>
                        <p><em>Note: This guide is based on aggregated public data from G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, and vendor documentation, not firsthand testing. Pricing for these tools is not publicly listed &mdash; ranges cited come from publicly available reports and review data.</em></p>

                        <h2>How to Choose the Right Platform</h2>
                        <p>The right conversation intelligence platform depends on your existing stack, team size, and whether you need standalone call intelligence or a broader revenue platform. Here is how to decide.</p>

                            <div class="use-case good">

                                    <li>Want the most powerful standalone conversation intelligence platform</li>
                                    <li>Have a team of 10+ reps running regular discovery and demo calls</li>
                                    <li>Need deep coaching analytics, talk pattern analysis, and methodology tracking</li>
                                    <li>Want the largest integration ecosystem across CRMs, dialers, and video platforms</li>
                                    <li>Need deal boards with AI-driven risk scoring based on conversation signals</li>

                        <div class="faq-list">
                            <div class="faq-item">
                                <h4 class="faq-question">What is conversation intelligence software?</h4>
                                <p class="faq-answer">Conversation intelligence software automatically records, transcribes, and analyzes sales calls and meetings. It uses AI to surface insights like talk-to-listen ratios, competitor mentions, pricing discussions, and objection patterns. Sales managers use it to coach reps, and leadership uses it to understand pipeline health based on what is actually being said in deals.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="faq-item">
                                <h4 class="faq-question">How much does Gong cost?</h4>
                                <p class="faq-answer">Gong uses custom pricing based on team size and usage. Based on publicly available information, most teams report costs of $100-$150 per user per month with annual contracts and minimum seat requirements. Gong does not publish pricing on their website, so you need to request a demo for a specific quote for your team.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="faq-item">
                                <h4 class="faq-question">Is Gong better than Chorus?</h4>
                                <p class="faq-answer">Gong (4.7/5 on G2) has higher user ratings and a more mature AI analytics platform with deeper coaching features. Chorus (4.5/5 on G2) is now part of ZoomInfo, which means it integrates deeply with ZoomInfo's contact data and intent signals. If you already use ZoomInfo, Chorus is the natural fit. If you want the strongest standalone conversation intelligence, Gong is the market leader. See our <a href="../compare/gong-vs-chorus.html">Gong vs Chorus comparison</a> for details.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="faq-item">
                                <h4 class="faq-question">Do I need conversation intelligence if I already have a CRM?</h4>
                                <p class="faq-answer">CRMs track pipeline data that reps manually enter. Conversation intelligence captures what actually happens on calls, which is often different from what gets logged. It fills the gap between what your CRM says about a deal and what is actually being discussed. For teams with 5+ reps running discovery and demo calls, it typically pays for itself through improved coaching and deal visibility.</p>

                            <div class="faq-item">
                                <h4 class="faq-question">Can conversation intelligence tools record calls without the other person knowing?</h4>
                                <p class="faq-answer">No. All major platforms (Gong, Chorus, Clari) announce themselves at the start of recorded calls and require consent in compliance with recording laws. They join meetings as visible participants and provide notification. You cannot secretly record calls with these tools. Most teams include recording consent language in their meeting invitations as an additional best practice.</p>
