                        <h2>What Is Conversation Intelligence?</h2>
                        <p>Conversation intelligence platforms record, transcribe, and analyze sales calls and meetings using AI. Instead of relying on a rep's memory or hastily typed CRM notes, these tools capture the actual conversation and extract structured data from it: what competitors were mentioned, what objections came up, how much the rep talked versus listened, and whether key topics were covered.</p>
                        <p>The category has matured significantly since Gong pioneered the market. Today, conversation intelligence intersects with several adjacent categories: revenue forecasting (Clari), sales intelligence (ZoomInfo/Chorus), and sales enablement. The lines between these categories are blurring as platforms expand their feature sets.</p>
                        <p>For sales leaders, the primary value of conversation intelligence falls into three buckets. First, deal visibility: understanding what is actually happening on calls rather than relying on what reps choose to log in the CRM. Second, coaching: using call recordings and AI-generated scorecards to improve rep performance systematically. Third, forecasting: aggregating conversation signals across the pipeline to predict which deals will close and which are at risk.</p>
                        <p>This guide compares the three dominant platforms in the space: Gong, Chorus (now part of ZoomInfo), and Clari. All three use custom pricing, so we rely on G2 reviewer data and industry reports for pricing estimates. All ratings are from G2. We do not claim firsthand testing of these platforms &mdash; see our <a href="../about.html">methodology</a> for details.</p>

                        <h2>Gong: The Market Leader</h2>
                        <p>Gong created the conversation intelligence category and remains its dominant player. With a 4.7/5 G2 rating and over 4,000 customers including LinkedIn, Hubspot, and Zillow, Gong has the deepest analytics, the most polished user experience, and the broadest integration ecosystem in the category.</p>
                        <p>Gong's core capability is turning unstructured conversation data into structured deal intelligence. Every call is automatically recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. The AI identifies topics discussed, questions asked, competitors mentioned, pricing conversations, and next steps. This data rolls up into deal boards that give managers a real-time view of pipeline health based on what is actually happening in conversations, not what reps enter into Salesforce.</p>
                        <p>Gong's coaching features are where many teams see the fastest ROI. Managers can review calls, leave timestamped comments, score rep performance against playbooks, and track improvement over time. The AI also surfaces patterns across the entire team: which talk tracks correlate with closed deals, what objection responses work best, and where reps consistently lose deals.</p>
                        <p>The main drawback is cost. Gong does not publish pricing, but G2 reviewers and industry analysts consistently report costs between $100 and $150 per user per month with annual contracts and minimum seat requirements (typically 10+ seats). For small teams, this investment is significant. Gong also lacks native contact data or prospecting features &mdash; it is purely a conversation analysis and deal intelligence platform.</p>
                        <p>For teams with 10+ reps, a structured sales process, and a commitment to data-driven coaching, Gong is the gold standard. Its depth of analytics and quality of AI insights remain ahead of competitors.</p>

                    <!-- Chorus Deep Dive -->
                    <div class="content-section" id="chorus">
                        <h2>Chorus: The ZoomInfo Ecosystem Play</h2>
                        <p>Chorus was acquired by ZoomInfo in 2021 and has since been integrated into ZoomInfo's broader revenue intelligence platform. With a 4.5/5 G2 rating, Chorus offers strong conversation intelligence capabilities &mdash; call recording, transcription, AI analysis, and coaching tools &mdash; but its primary differentiator is now its integration with ZoomInfo's data assets.</p>
                        <p>For teams already using ZoomInfo for contact data and intent signals, adding Chorus creates a unified view from prospecting through deal execution. ZoomInfo's contact data enriches call participants with firmographic and technographic information. Intent signals from ZoomInfo can be cross-referenced with conversation topics to identify accounts that are both showing buying intent and engaging in relevant conversations.</p>
                        <p>Chorus's standalone conversation intelligence features are solid but generally considered a step behind Gong's. G2 reviewers frequently note that Gong's AI insights are more accurate, the user interface is more intuitive, and the analytics dashboards offer more depth. However, for teams evaluating Chorus as part of a ZoomInfo bundle, the incremental cost is often significantly lower than adding Gong as a standalone platform.</p>
                        <p>Chorus works best for organizations that have standardized on ZoomInfo for sales intelligence and want to consolidate their tech stack under one vendor. The data integration between ZoomInfo's contact database, intent signals, and Chorus's conversation data creates value that neither Gong nor standalone Chorus can replicate.</p>
                        <p>The risk with the ZoomInfo ecosystem approach is vendor lock-in. If your team later decides to move away from ZoomInfo, extracting Chorus data and migrating to a competitor involves more friction than switching standalone tools.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Clari Deep Dive -->
                    <div class="content-section" id="clari">
                        <h2>Clari: Revenue Operations with Conversation Intelligence</h2>
                        <p>Clari (4.6/5 on G2) is primarily a revenue operations platform, not a conversation intelligence tool. Its core strength is pipeline management and revenue forecasting. Clari aggregates data from CRM, email, calendar, and conversations to provide a unified view of pipeline health and forecast accuracy.</p>
                        <p>Clari added conversation intelligence through its acquisition of Wingman in 2022. The conversation features include real-time call transcription, AI-generated summaries, topic detection, and cue cards that prompt reps during live calls. While these features are functional, they are not as deep as Gong's or even Chorus's conversation analytics.</p>
                        <p>Where Clari excels is in tying conversation data to revenue outcomes. Rather than treating call analytics as a standalone function, Clari uses conversation signals as one input among many for its forecast models. When a deal's conversation activity drops off, or when a champion stops attending calls, Clari flags the deal as at risk. This integrated approach to revenue intelligence is Clari's differentiator.</p>
                        <p>Clari is the right choice for organizations where revenue forecasting and pipeline management are higher priorities than call coaching. If your VP of Sales cares more about forecast accuracy than individual rep coaching, Clari's combination of pipeline analytics and conversation intelligence delivers more value than Gong or Chorus alone.</p>
                        <p>However, if your primary goal is coaching reps and improving conversation quality, Gong remains the stronger platform. Clari's coaching features are limited compared to Gong's timestamped comments, performance scorecards, and AI-driven coaching recommendations.</p>
