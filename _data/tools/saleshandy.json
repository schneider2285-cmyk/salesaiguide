      "Saleshandy is a cold email outreach platform built around one core value proposition: unlimited email accounts at a flat monthly price. Where Instantly and Smartlead charge per mailbox or per sending account, Saleshandy includes unlimited connected email accounts on every plan — making it the default choice for agencies managing multiple client domains and founders who want to rotate across many inboxes without a per-seat penalty.",
      "The platform covers the full cold email workflow: lead prospecting via its built-in B2B database (200M+ contacts), multi-step email sequences with conditional branching, email warm-up to protect deliverability, and a unified inbox for managing replies across all connected accounts. It does not have a native dialer, LinkedIn automation, or advanced CRM functionality — it is a focused cold email tool, not a full sales engagement platform.",
      "Saleshandy competes directly with Instantly.ai and Smartlead.ai in the cold email category. Its differentiation is price and the unlimited accounts model. Its weakness relative to both competitors is a less polished UI and a smaller community of power users sharing templates and best practices."
