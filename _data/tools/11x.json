    "verdict": "11x is an autonomous AI SDR platform that handles prospecting, multi-channel outreach, and meeting booking without human SDRs. The concept is compelling — replace or augment SDR headcount with AI. The execution has been mixed: strong for teams with a crystal-clear ICP and proven messaging, problematic for teams with niche ICPs or those expecting the AI to figure out targeting.",
    "bestFor": "Lean B2B GTM teams with a well-defined ICP, proven messaging, and the budget for a $5,000+/month annual contract. Best as an augmentation layer alongside human SDRs, not a full replacement.",

Alice handles the full SDR workflow autonomously — prospect research, personalized multi-channel outreach (email, LinkedIn, phone), objection handling, and meeting booking. Julian handles inbound phone qualification. The platform is SOC 2 compliant and positions itself as 'enterprise-ready.' Founded in 2022, 11x has raised significant venture funding and reported over $5M ARR as of mid-2025. However, a March 2025 report described the product as 'glitchy' despite strong backing, and user reviews cite issues with irrelevant leads, duplicates, and AI hallucinations.",
