      "Lemlist is a multi-channel cold outreach platform that built its reputation on one feature: personalized images and videos in cold emails. Where most cold email tools treat personalization as inserting a first name into a template, Lemlist lets you automatically embed a prospect's name, company logo, or LinkedIn photo into a custom image — making each email look hand-crafted even when sent at scale.",
      "Since its founding in 2018, Lemlist has expanded well beyond personalized images. The platform now covers the full multi-channel outreach workflow: email sequences, LinkedIn automation (connection requests, messages, profile visits), phone call steps, and a built-in B2B lead database with 450M+ contacts. The AI features generate personalized icebreakers, suggest optimal send times, and help write sequence copy.",
      "Lemlist sits between pure cold email tools (Instantly, Smartlead, Saleshandy) and full sales engagement platforms (Outreach, Salesloft). It is more capable than cold email tools for multi-channel outreach but less enterprise-ready than Outreach for complex sales processes. The sweet spot is SMB and mid-market sales teams who want to run genuine multi-channel outbound without the complexity or cost of an enterprise SEP."
