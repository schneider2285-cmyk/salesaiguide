      {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does 11x actually work?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "It depends heavily on your ICP clarity and messaging quality. Teams with well-defined ICPs and proven messaging report positive results. Teams with niche ICPs or expecting the AI to figure out targeting report irrelevant leads, duplicates, and hallucinations."}},

However, the high cost, long contracts, and reported quality issues mean the ROI is uncertain."}},
