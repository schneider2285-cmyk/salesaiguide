It also includes AI sequencing and signal-based prospecting that Orum lacks. However, Orum has a stronger enterprise security posture. The best choice depends on your security requirements and whether you want a pure dialer or a broader platform."}},

Nooks' 2025 AI sequencing launch competes with email sequencing in Outreach and Salesloft. However, Outreach and Salesloft have deeper CRM integrations and more mature sequencing features."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What are the security concerns with Nooks?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The Nooks Chrome extension requests broad permissions to read and change all your data on all websites. A third-party security assessment (SaaSPosture) gave Nooks a Grade C (41/100). This is a concern for enterprise InfoSec teams."}},
