      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is RegieOne?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "RegieOne is Regie.ai's unified platform that combines AI Agents (prospecting and sequence automation), AI Dialer, and content generation in a single interface. It is offered free with an annual AI Agents contract starting at $35K/year."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How does Regie.ai compare to Outreach and Salesloft?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Regie.ai is positioned as an AI-native alternative to traditional SEPs. It has stronger AI content generation and includes a built-in AI Dialer, but has fewer integrations and a smaller ecosystem than Outreach or Salesloft. Teams deeply embedded in Outreach/Salesloft workflows often use Regie.ai alongside rather than as a replacement."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is Regie.ai's pricing?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Regie.ai starts at $35,000/year for AI Agents. The RegieOne bundle (AI Agents + AI Dialer) is included at the same price. Professional services for onboarding and training are priced separately."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Regie.ai SOC 2 compliant?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Regie.ai is SOC 2 compliant and GDPR compliant. SSO is available. The platform is listed on the Salesforce AppExchange, which requires security review."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Regie.ai have a free trial?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "No. Regie.ai uses an enterprise sales process — a demo and sales conversation are required before access is provided."}}
