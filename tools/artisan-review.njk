      {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Artisan replace a human SDR?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Artisan is designed to automate the full outbound SDR workflow — lead research, email writing, and follow-up. However, most teams still need a human to review campaigns, handle replies, and manage edge cases. It reduces SDR headcount needs but rarely eliminates them entirely."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How does Artisan compare to 11x?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Both are autonomous AI SDR platforms. Artisan has a larger contact database (300M+) and stronger CRM integrations. 11x has a slightly better G2 rating (4.4 vs 3.8) and more reviews. Neither has the review volume to make confident at-scale comparisons."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is Artisan's pricing?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Artisan does not publish pricing publicly. Based on user reports, pricing starts at approximately $2,000/month on an annual contract. A demo is required before pricing is disclosed."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Artisan have a free trial?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "No. Artisan requires a demo call before pricing or access is provided. There is no self-serve free trial."}},
