      {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Clay worth $149/month?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "For teams that currently subscribe to multiple data providers (Apollo, ZoomInfo, Hunter, etc.), Clay often saves money by consolidating into one credit-based system. If you only need one data source, a dedicated tool may be cheaper."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How fast do Clay credits get used up?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Credit consumption varies by workflow complexity. Simple lookups use 1 credit each, but multi-step enrichment workflows with AI can burn through credits quickly. Most teams on the Explorer plan (10K credits) support 2-3 active reps."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can Clay replace ZoomInfo or Apollo?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Clay aggregates data from 50+ providers including ZoomInfo and Apollo, so it can replace direct subscriptions in many cases. However, Clay doesn't include a built-in CRM or email sending like Apollo does."}}
