            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does HubSpot have call recording like Gong?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "HubSpot Sales Hub includes call recording and basic transcription. Gong's AI analysis is far more sophisticated — it surfaces talk ratios, competitor mentions, deal risk signals, and coaching recommendations that HubSpot's recording does not provide."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Gong worth the cost if I already have HubSpot?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "For teams with 10+ reps where call quality and deal health visibility are priorities, Gong's intelligence layer typically justifies the cost. For smaller teams or teams with primarily inbound motion, HubSpot's built-in recording is sufficient."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is better for a VP of Sales?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A VP of Sales benefits more from Gong — it provides deal risk alerts, forecast signals, and rep coaching data that HubSpot's CRM view doesn't surface. HubSpot is better for the CRM and pipeline management layer that a VP also needs, which is why many teams use both."}}
