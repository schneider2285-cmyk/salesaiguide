            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do Gong and Outreach compete or complement each other?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "They complement each other. Outreach manages rep workflows and sequences; Gong analyzes what happens on calls and surfaces deal risk. Most enterprise teams use both: Outreach for execution, Gong for intelligence and coaching."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Outreach have call recording like Gong?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Outreach has a call recording feature (Outreach Kaia), but it is less sophisticated than Gong's AI analysis. Gong's call intelligence — talk ratios, sentiment analysis, competitor mentions, deal risk signals — is significantly deeper than Outreach's native recording."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which should I buy first?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "For most teams, Outreach (or Salesloft) comes first as the foundation for rep workflow. Gong is typically added once the team is running sequences consistently and managers want visibility into call quality and deal health."}}
