<!-- Section 1: The Core Difference -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>Artisan vs Clay: Two Very Different Bets on AI Outbound</h2>
  <p>Artisan and Clay both promise to transform outbound prospecting with AI, but they represent fundamentally different philosophies. Artisan bets on autonomy: give the AI your ICP and let it run. Clay bets on control: give your team a powerful toolkit to build exactly the workflow they need.</p>
  <p>This is not a close comparison in most dimensions — they are designed for different buyers with different technical resources and different tolerance for customization complexity.</p>

  <p class="compare-note">Clay's headline pricing is much lower, but a fully operational Clay stack (Clay + outreach tool + data credits) can reach $1,000–$3,000/month for a serious outbound operation. Artisan's all-in pricing may be comparable when you account for the full stack Clay requires.</p>
</section>

<!-- Section 5: Who Should Choose Each -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>Who Should Choose Artisan?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-technical founders or small teams who want AI to handle outbound without building workflows</li>
    <li>Companies without a RevOps engineer or dedicated sales ops resource</li>
    <li>Teams that want a single vendor for prospecting and outreach, not a multi-tool stack</li>
    <li>Buyers who are comfortable with less control in exchange for a faster time-to-pipeline</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Should Choose Clay?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Technical RevOps teams that want to build highly customized, multi-source enrichment workflows</li>
    <li>Growth teams running sophisticated outbound with complex ICP filters and personalization logic</li>
    <li>Organizations that already have an outreach tool and need better data and personalization upstream</li>
    <li>Agencies and consultants building outbound infrastructure for multiple clients</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- Section 6: The Verdict -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>The Verdict: Turnkey vs Power Tool</h2>
  <p>Clay is the more powerful tool by almost every objective measure — better data quality, more customization, higher G2 rating, and a proven track record with sophisticated outbound teams. But power comes with complexity, and Clay requires technical resources that many smaller teams simply do not have.</p>
  <p>Artisan fills a real gap: teams that want AI-driven outbound without the overhead of building and maintaining a Clay workflow. If you have the technical resources, Clay is the stronger long-term investment. If you do not, Artisan's turnkey approach is more practical — even if it means accepting less control over how the AI operates.</p>
