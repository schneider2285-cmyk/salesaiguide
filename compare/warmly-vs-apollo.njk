            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Are Warmly and Apollo solving the same problem?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "No. Apollo is an outbound prospecting tool — you build lists and send cold emails. Warmly is an inbound intent tool — it identifies companies already visiting your website and alerts your team. They complement each other rather than compete directly."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Warmly worth $700/mo?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "For teams with meaningful website traffic (500+ target account visits/month), Warmly can surface high-intent leads that would otherwise go unnoticed. For teams with low website traffic or no inbound motion, the ROI is harder to justify at this price point."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can I use Warmly with Apollo?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. A common workflow is using Warmly to identify high-intent website visitors, then using Apollo to find contact details and enrich the account before reaching out. Warmly's Salesforce and HubSpot integrations make this handoff straightforward."}}
