            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Lusha cheaper than ZoomInfo?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Significantly. Lusha starts at $29/mo with a free tier; ZoomInfo requires a custom enterprise contract typically starting at $15,000+/year. For individual reps or small teams, Lusha's self-serve pricing is far more accessible."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does ZoomInfo have better data than Lusha?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "ZoomInfo's database is larger and includes deeper company intelligence (org charts, technographics, intent data). Lusha's strength is speed and ease of use for individual contact lookup, not breadth of company data."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can a small team use ZoomInfo?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "ZoomInfo's minimum contract size and enterprise-only sales process make it impractical for teams under 10 seats. Lusha, Apollo, or LeadIQ are better fits for small teams that need self-serve access."}}
