            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Gong or Clari better for sales forecasting?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Clari is purpose-built for forecasting — its AI models are specifically trained on pipeline data to predict deal outcomes. Gong's forecasting is a secondary feature added to its call intelligence core. For teams where forecast accuracy is the primary need, Clari is the stronger choice."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do Gong and Clari integrate with each other?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, Gong and Clari have a native integration. Many enterprise revenue teams use both: Gong for call intelligence and coaching, Clari for pipeline management and forecasting. The integration passes deal activity signals from Gong into Clari's forecasting models."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is more expensive?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Both are enterprise-only with custom pricing. Gong is typically priced per seat for call recording plus a platform fee; Clari is typically priced per seat for the full platform. Most enterprises report similar total cost, though Gong's pricing scales more predictably with seat count."}}
