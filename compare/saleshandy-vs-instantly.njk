Saleshandy includes unlimited accounts on all plans including the $36/month entry tier. Instantly includes unlimited accounts on its Growth plan ($97/month) but limits accounts on the lower Sending Warmup tier. For agencies managing 10+ client domains, Saleshandy's lower entry price is an advantage. Instantly has better UI and a larger community of agency users sharing templates and best practices."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which has better deliverability, Saleshandy or Instantly?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Instantly is generally considered to have stronger deliverability infrastructure. It has a larger warm-up network, dedicated IP options, and more granular sending controls. Saleshandy's warm-up is effective but has a smaller warm-up pool. In practice, both achieve good inbox placement when used correctly — the difference is most noticeable for new domains being warmed up from scratch."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Saleshandy have a built-in lead database that Instantly lacks?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Saleshandy includes access to a 700M+ contact B2B database with email verification. Instantly does not have a built-in lead database — you need to import your own prospects or use a separate tool like Apollo or Clay. Saleshandy's database is useful for SMB prospecting but not a replacement for enterprise-grade data tools."}}

                        <h2>The Closest Comparison in Cold Email</h2>
                        <p>Saleshandy and Instantly are the most directly comparable cold email tools on the market. Both offer unlimited email accounts, built-in warm-up, automated sequences, and flat-rate pricing starting around $36–37/month. The differences are meaningful but not dramatic — this is a genuine toss-up for many buyers.</p>
                        <p>Instantly wins on deliverability infrastructure, UI quality, and community size. Its warm-up network is larger, its interface is cleaner, and it has a significantly larger community of power users sharing templates, best practices, and campaign strategies. For most individual SDRs and small teams, Instantly is the better default choice.</p>
                        <p>Saleshandy wins on entry-level unlimited accounts (available from $36/month vs Instantly's $97/month Growth plan) and on the built-in B2B lead database. For agencies managing multiple client domains who want unlimited accounts at the absolute lowest cost, Saleshandy is the better choice at the entry tier.</p>

                                    <li>You want a built-in B2B lead database without a separate Apollo or ZoomInfo subscription</li>

                    <section class="content-section" id="where-it-breaks">
                        <h2>Where Each Tool Breaks</h2>
                        <p><strong>Saleshandy breaks</strong> when you need the best UI or the largest community. Its interface is functional but less polished than Instantly, and the smaller community means fewer public resources for troubleshooting and optimization. The built-in lead database is useful but not enterprise-grade.</p>
                        <p><strong>Instantly breaks</strong> when you need unlimited accounts at the lowest possible price. Its unlimited accounts feature requires the Growth plan ($97/month) — the entry Sending Warmup plan ($37/month) limits connected accounts. For agencies managing 20+ domains on a tight budget, Saleshandy's entry-tier unlimited accounts is a meaningful advantage.</p>
