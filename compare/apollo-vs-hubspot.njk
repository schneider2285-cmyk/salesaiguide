            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Apollo better than HubSpot for cold outreach?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Apollo wins on outbound: built-in sequences, 275M contact database, email warmup. HubSpot's sequences are limited on lower tiers and lack Apollo's prospecting depth. If cold outreach is your primary motion, Apollo is the stronger choice."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can I use Apollo and HubSpot together?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, this is a very common stack. Apollo handles prospecting and initial outreach; HubSpot manages the CRM, deal tracking, and inbound leads. Apollo's native HubSpot integration syncs contacts, activities, and sequences bidirectionally."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is better for a small sales team?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "HubSpot's free CRM tier makes it the default starting point for small teams. Apollo's free tier (10K leads/mo) is strong for prospecting. Most small teams start with HubSpot CRM free + Apollo free, then upgrade Apollo as outbound volume grows."}}
