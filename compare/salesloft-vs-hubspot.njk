Many teams use HubSpot as their CRM and Salesloft as their sales engagement platform, syncing activities, contacts, and deal stages bidirectionally."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Salesloft or HubSpot better for a 20-person sales team?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "It depends on the motion. If the team is primarily inbound, HubSpot Sales Hub Professional handles sequences and pipeline management well. If the team runs significant outbound, Salesloft's cadence management and coaching features justify the additional cost."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which has better call recording?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Salesloft's Conversations product includes call recording, AI transcription, and coaching features. HubSpot's call recording is more basic and lacks the coaching layer. For teams that prioritize call intelligence, Salesloft is the stronger choice."}}
