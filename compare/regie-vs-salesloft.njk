  <p class="compare-note">Salesloft is significantly cheaper for teams under 30 reps. The cost gap narrows for larger teams, and Regie.ai's included AI prospecting agents can offset the difference if they reduce the need for a separate data vendor.</p>
</section>

<!-- Section 4: Who Should Choose Each -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>Who Should Choose Regie.ai?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Teams with 20+ SDRs where AI content quality and consistency is the primary bottleneck</li>
    <li>RevOps leaders who want to consolidate prospecting, sequencing, and AI content in one platform</li>
    <li>Organizations that have outgrown Salesloft's template-based approach and need AI-generated, persona-aware messaging</li>
    <li>Buyers evaluating a modern, AI-native alternative to legacy SEPs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Should Choose Salesloft?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mid-market teams (10–50 reps) where Salesloft's per-seat pricing is significantly more affordable</li>
    <li>Teams that use conversation intelligence and deal management alongside cadences</li>
    <li>Organizations that value platform maturity, mobile support, and a large customer community</li>
    <li>Buyers who want a proven platform with 4,100+ G2 reviews before committing to a newer entrant</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- Section 5: The Verdict -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>The Verdict: AI-Native vs Proven Platform</h2>
  <p>Regie.ai and Salesloft are closer competitors than Regie.ai and Outreach, because both focus primarily on the SDR workflow rather than full revenue operations. The key differentiator is AI depth versus platform breadth.</p>
  <p>Regie.ai wins on AI content quality — its sequence generation, persona-aware messaging, and autonomous prospecting agents are genuinely more advanced than Salesloft's AI features. But Salesloft wins on everything else: broader feature set, better mobile experience, more integrations, and a much larger evidence base from 4,100+ G2 reviews.</p>
  <p>The decision often comes down to team size and primary pain point. For teams under 20 reps where budget matters, Salesloft is the safer, more cost-effective choice. For larger teams where SDR content quality and AI-driven prospecting are the primary levers, Regie.ai's AI-first architecture justifies the premium.</p>
