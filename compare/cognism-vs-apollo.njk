It maintains GDPR-compliant data with built-in TPS/CTPS checks and phone-verified mobile numbers for European contacts. Apollo's EU data coverage is thinner and lacks the same compliance infrastructure."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Apollo have GDPR compliance?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Apollo has a GDPR compliance framework and EU data processing agreements, but it is not purpose-built for GDPR the way Cognism is. Cognism's data team actively removes contacts from suppression lists; Apollo relies more on user-side compliance controls."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which has better data accuracy?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "For North America, Apollo's 275M contact database is generally more comprehensive. For EMEA, Cognism's phone-verified mobile numbers have a reputation for higher accuracy, particularly for UK and DACH markets."}}
