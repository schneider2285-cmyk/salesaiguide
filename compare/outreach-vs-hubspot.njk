            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Outreach better than HubSpot for sales sequences?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "For complex, high-volume outbound sequences, Outreach is more powerful — it offers A/B testing, advanced branching logic, and deeper analytics than HubSpot's sequences. HubSpot's sequences are sufficient for most inbound-led teams but lack Outreach's sophistication."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does HubSpot replace the need for Outreach?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "For teams with a primarily inbound motion, HubSpot's Sales Hub can replace Outreach. For enterprise teams running high-volume outbound with complex multi-channel sequences, Outreach's dedicated SEP capabilities are hard to replicate in HubSpot."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is easier to set up?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "HubSpot is significantly easier to set up and administer. Outreach requires dedicated RevOps resources for configuration, sequence governance, and ongoing maintenance. HubSpot's sequences can be live within hours; Outreach typically takes weeks to configure properly."}}
