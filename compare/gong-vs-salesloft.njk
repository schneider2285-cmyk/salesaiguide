            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Gong or Salesloft better for sales coaching?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Gong is the stronger coaching tool. Its AI analyzes call recordings for talk ratios, filler words, competitor mentions, and deal risk signals, then surfaces coaching recommendations. Salesloft's Conversations product includes call recording but lacks Gong's depth of AI analysis."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do Gong and Salesloft compete or complement each other?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "They overlap on call recording but compete on positioning. Many enterprise teams use both: Salesloft for cadence management and rep workflow, Gong for call intelligence and manager coaching. The combination is expensive but covers the full revenue workflow."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is better for forecasting?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Gong's Revenue Intelligence product includes AI-powered forecasting. Salesloft's forecasting is less developed. For teams that prioritize forecast accuracy, Gong or Clari are stronger choices than Salesloft."}}
