            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does HubSpot have forecasting like Clari?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "HubSpot has a forecasting tool built into Sales Hub that shows pipeline by deal stage and weighted probability. Clari's AI forecasting is significantly more sophisticated — it analyzes CRM activity, email engagement, and historical patterns to predict deal outcomes with higher accuracy."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Clari worth the cost if I already have HubSpot?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "For teams with 20+ reps and $5M+ in pipeline, Clari's forecast accuracy improvements typically justify the cost. For smaller teams, HubSpot's built-in forecasting is sufficient and Clari's enterprise pricing is hard to justify."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Clari integrate with HubSpot?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, Clari has a HubSpot integration. It pulls deal and activity data from HubSpot into its forecasting models. This is less common than Clari's Salesforce integration but is supported for HubSpot-native teams."}}
