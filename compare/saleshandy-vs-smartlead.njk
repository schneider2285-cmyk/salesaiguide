It has native multi-client management, white-label options, and more sophisticated automation. Saleshandy is better for cost-conscious agencies who need unlimited email accounts at the lowest price — its $36/month entry tier with unlimited accounts is cheaper than Smartlead's comparable plans."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Smartlead have better AI features than Saleshandy?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Smartlead's AI-powered sequence branching automatically adjusts follow-up sequences based on prospect behavior — it can detect sentiment in replies and route prospects to different sequence paths. Saleshandy's automation is more traditional: conditional branching based on opens and clicks, but without the AI-driven reply analysis that Smartlead offers."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is cheaper, Saleshandy or Smartlead?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Saleshandy is slightly cheaper at the entry tier ($36/month vs Smartlead's $39/month). Both include unlimited email accounts. The pricing difference is small enough that the decision should be based on features rather than cost."}}

                        <h2>The Key Differentiator: AI Branching vs Built-in Database</h2>
                        <p>Saleshandy and Smartlead are closely matched on price and core cold email features. Both include unlimited email accounts, warm-up, and automated sequences. The meaningful differences are Smartlead's AI-powered sequence branching and white-label agency features versus Saleshandy's built-in B2B lead database.</p>
                        <p>Smartlead's AI branching is genuinely differentiated — it can detect the sentiment of a reply (positive, neutral, objection) and automatically route the prospect to a different sequence path. This reduces the manual work of managing replies at scale and can improve conversion rates for complex multi-step campaigns. Saleshandy's conditional branching is based on opens and clicks only, not reply content.</p>
                        <p>Saleshandy's 700M+ contact database means you can prospect and send from a single platform without a separate Apollo or ZoomInfo subscription. For SMBs with limited tool budgets, this is a meaningful cost saving. Smartlead has no built-in prospecting — you must import your own lists.</p>

                                    <li>You want a built-in B2B lead database to avoid a separate prospecting tool subscription</li>

                        <h2>Where Each Tool Breaks</h2>
                        <p><strong>Saleshandy breaks</strong> when you need sophisticated AI automation or agency-grade multi-client management. Its sequence branching is limited to opens/clicks (not reply content), and it lacks the white-label and client portal features that Smartlead offers for agencies.</p>
                        <p><strong>Smartlead breaks</strong> when you need a built-in prospecting database. Without a native lead database, you must maintain a separate Apollo, ZoomInfo, or Clay subscription to source contacts — adding $50–200+/month to your stack cost. For SMBs on tight budgets, this is a meaningful disadvantage.</p>
