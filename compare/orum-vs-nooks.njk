It has deeper Salesforce integration, more mature admin controls, and a longer track record with large SDR organizations. Nooks is catching up fast but Orum's enterprise-grade call recording, compliance features, and dedicated CSM support give it an edge for teams with 20+ reps."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do Orum and Nooks compare on connect rates?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Both tools use AI to detect live answers and skip voicemails, which typically improves connect rates by 3-5x compared to manual dialing. Nooks users on G2 and Reddit report slightly higher satisfaction with connect rate consistency, particularly for outbound-heavy teams. Orum's AI has been refined longer and tends to perform better on enterprise contact databases."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do Orum and Nooks integrate with Salesforce and HubSpot?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Both tools integrate with Salesforce and HubSpot. Orum's Salesforce integration is considered more mature, with bidirectional sync, call logging, and disposition mapping. Nooks integrates with both CRMs plus Outreach, Salesloft, and Apollo. For HubSpot-first teams, Nooks is generally the better fit."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is easier to set up — Orum or Nooks?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Nooks is consistently rated easier to set up and onboard. G2 reviews cite a faster time-to-first-call and a more intuitive interface. Orum has more configuration options which adds setup complexity, though it also provides dedicated onboarding support for enterprise accounts."}}

                        <p>Orum and Nooks are the two most credible AI parallel dialers on the market in 2026. They're more similar than different — both use AI to detect live answers, both offer virtual salesfloors, and both require annual contracts with custom pricing. The decision comes down to team size, CRM stack, and how much you value AI coaching.</p>
                        <p><strong>Choose Orum</strong> if you're running a large SDR organization (20+ reps) on Salesforce, need enterprise-grade compliance and admin controls, and have the runway to invest in a thorough implementation. Orum's longer track record with enterprise customers and its deeper Salesforce integration make it the safer choice at scale.</p>
                        <p><strong>Choose Nooks</strong> if you're a mid-market or SMB team that wants to be live quickly, values real-time AI coaching, or runs on HubSpot or Apollo. Nooks has a significantly larger G2 review base (1,107 vs 312), higher rep satisfaction scores, and a reputation for faster onboarding. For teams under 20 reps, Nooks is the stronger default.</p>
