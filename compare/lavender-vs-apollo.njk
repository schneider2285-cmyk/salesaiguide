            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Apollo have an AI email writer like Lavender?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Apollo has AI email generation that writes first drafts. Lavender's approach is different — it coaches you on emails you've already written, scoring them in real time and suggesting specific improvements. Lavender is a writing coach; Apollo is a writing generator."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can I use Lavender with Apollo sequences?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Lavender works as a Chrome extension inside Gmail and most SEPs. You can write emails in Apollo's sequence editor and use Lavender's sidebar to score and improve them before sending."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is better for improving reply rates?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Lavender's real-time coaching approach is specifically designed to improve reply rates — it scores emails against patterns from millions of sent emails. Apollo's AI generation is faster but doesn't provide the same feedback loop. Teams focused on email quality often use both."}}
