            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Seismic or MindTickle better for a new sales enablement program?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "They solve different problems. Seismic is a content management platform — it helps reps find and share the right content at the right time. MindTickle is a readiness platform — it trains reps and certifies their knowledge. Most mature enablement programs need both."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which integrates better with Salesforce?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Both have strong Salesforce integrations. Seismic's integration focuses on surfacing content recommendations within Salesforce opportunities. MindTickle's integration focuses on triggering training based on deal stage or rep performance data in Salesforce."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can a mid-market company afford Seismic?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Seismic is primarily positioned for large enterprise (500+ employees). Mid-market teams often find Highspot or Showpad more accessible in terms of implementation complexity and pricing. MindTickle has more mid-market deployments than Seismic."}}
