            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does LeadIQ have email sequences like Apollo?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "No. LeadIQ is a data capture and enrichment tool — it does not include email sequencing. You capture contacts via LeadIQ and sync them to Outreach, Salesloft, or Apollo for sequencing. Apollo is the all-in-one option if you want prospecting and sequences in one platform."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is LeadIQ's Scribe feature?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Scribe uses AI to write personalized first lines for cold emails based on a prospect's LinkedIn activity, recent posts, and job changes. It's one of LeadIQ's key differentiators over Apollo and Lusha, which don't offer AI-generated personalization at the point of capture."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which has better CRM integration?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Both integrate with Salesforce and HubSpot. Apollo's CRM sync is deeper for sales engagement workflows; LeadIQ's sync is cleaner for simple contact creation. Teams using Outreach or Salesloft often prefer LeadIQ's native integrations with those platforms."}}
