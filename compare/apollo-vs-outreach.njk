Apollo includes a contact database, email sequences, and a basic dialer — covering most of what Outreach does for outbound. However, Outreach has significantly deeper pipeline management, deal inspection, AI coaching, and enterprise compliance features. Teams that rely on Outreach's analytics depth and enterprise workflow automation will find Apollo a meaningful downgrade in those areas."

For a team of 10 reps, Apollo costs roughly $6,000/year versus $12,000–$18,000/year for Outreach. The cost difference is substantial enough that many SMB and mid-market teams choose Apollo even if they would prefer Outreach's feature depth."

<!-- Section 1: The Core Question -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>Apollo.io vs Outreach: All-in-One vs Enterprise Platform</h2>
  <p>Apollo and Outreach are both sales engagement platforms, but they serve fundamentally different buyer profiles. Apollo is built for individual SDRs and small teams who need prospecting + sequencing in one affordable tool. Outreach is built for enterprise and mid-market teams with dedicated RevOps functions who need deep workflow automation, pipeline management, and enterprise compliance. The overlap in features is real, but the target customer is not the same.</p>
