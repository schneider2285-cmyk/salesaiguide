<!-- Section 4: Who Should Choose Each -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>Who Should Choose Regie.ai?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Teams whose primary pain point is SDR content quality and sequence consistency</li>
    <li>RevOps leaders who want AI-generated sequences with human review, not just templates</li>
    <li>Organizations looking to consolidate prospecting and engagement into one AI-native platform</li>
    <li>Teams willing to pay a premium for AI-first architecture over a retrofitted legacy platform</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Should Choose Outreach?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enterprise teams that need robust pipeline management and revenue forecasting alongside engagement</li>
    <li>Organizations with 50+ reps where Outreach's depth of analytics and workflow automation pays off</li>
    <li>Teams already deeply integrated with Outreach's ecosystem (Commit, Kaia, etc.)</li>
    <li>Buyers who prioritize platform maturity and a proven enterprise track record over AI-first design</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- Section 5: The Verdict -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>The Verdict: AI-Native vs Battle-Tested</h2>
  <p>Regie.ai and Outreach represent two different philosophies about how AI fits into sales engagement. Outreach built a dominant platform over 15 years and has been adding AI capabilities on top. Regie.ai was built AI-first from day one, with content generation and autonomous agents as the core product, not an afterthought.</p>
  <p>For teams where the primary bottleneck is SDR content quality and sequence effectiveness, Regie.ai's AI-first approach delivers a meaningfully better experience. For teams that need the full enterprise suite — pipeline management, forecasting, deal inspection, and engagement in one platform — Outreach's depth is hard to match.</p>
  <p>The practical question is whether you are replacing a broken outbound motion (Regie.ai's strength) or optimizing a mature revenue operation (Outreach's strength).</p>
