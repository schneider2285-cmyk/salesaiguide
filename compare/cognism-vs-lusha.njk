            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Cognism or Lusha better for UK prospecting?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Cognism is significantly stronger for UK prospecting. Its phone-verified mobile numbers and TPS/CTPS compliance checks are purpose-built for the UK market. Lusha's UK data coverage is thinner and lacks the same compliance infrastructure."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Lusha have a free tier?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, Lusha offers 5 free credits per month with no credit card required. Cognism has no free tier and requires a sales call to get pricing. For individual reps testing a data tool, Lusha is far more accessible."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is better for a team of 5 SDRs?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Lusha's Pro plan ($29/mo) is more practical for a small team. Cognism's minimum contract is enterprise-sized and requires negotiation. Unless the team is primarily prospecting in EMEA, Lusha or Apollo is a better fit at this scale."}}
