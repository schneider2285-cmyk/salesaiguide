<!-- Section 1: The Core Question -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>Orum vs Salesloft: Specialist vs Platform</h2>
  <p>This comparison addresses a common question from SDR managers: should we add Orum on top of Salesloft, or consolidate everything into Salesloft and drop the separate dialer? The answer depends almost entirely on your team's call volume and how central phone outreach is to your pipeline generation strategy.</p>

<!-- Section 4: The Stack Question -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>Should You Run Orum + Salesloft Together?</h2>
  <p>The most common deployment pattern is Orum + Salesloft, not Orum instead of Salesloft. Here is how the stack works in practice:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Salesloft manages email sequences, cadence steps, LinkedIn tasks, and CRM sync</li>
    <li>Orum handles all phone steps in the cadence, replacing Salesloft's built-in dialer</li>
    <li>Reps work primarily in Salesloft but launch calls through Orum's interface</li>
    <li>Call recordings and dispositions sync back to Salesloft and the CRM automatically</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This stack makes sense when phone is a primary channel and your reps are doing 50+ dials per day. The parallel dialing advantage compounds at high volume — a rep doing 100 dials per day with Orum will have significantly more live conversations than the same rep using Salesloft's standard dialer.</p>
</section>

<!-- Section 5: Who Should Choose Each -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>When to Add Orum to Your Salesloft Stack</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your SDRs are doing 50+ dials per day and phone is a primary pipeline channel</li>
    <li>Live conversation rate is below 5% and you need to increase connect rates</li>
    <li>You want real-time AI coaching during calls, not just post-call analysis</li>
    <li>Your team has clean contact data — parallel dialing amplifies bad data problems</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When Salesloft's Built-in Dialer Is Sufficient</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your team does fewer than 30 dials per rep per day</li>
    <li>Phone is a secondary channel and email/LinkedIn drive most pipeline</li>
    <li>Budget is constrained and adding a separate dialer tool is hard to justify</li>
    <li>Your contact data quality is inconsistent — fix data before adding parallel dialing</li>
  </ul>
