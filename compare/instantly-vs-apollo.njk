            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Instantly or Apollo better for cold email?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Instantly is purpose-built for cold email at scale — unlimited mailboxes, built-in warmup, and deliverability-first design. Apollo's sequences are solid but secondary to its prospecting database. For teams whose primary workflow is cold email volume, Instantly is the stronger choice."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Apollo have unlimited mailboxes like Instantly?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "No. Apollo limits the number of sending accounts per plan. Instantly's Growth plan allows unlimited email accounts, which is a significant advantage for teams running high-volume cold email campaigns across multiple domains."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can I use Instantly and Apollo together?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, this is a popular stack. Use Apollo to build and enrich prospect lists, then export to Instantly for sending. Apollo's CSV export makes this workflow straightforward, though it requires manual transfer rather than a native integration."}}
