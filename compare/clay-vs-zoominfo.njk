ZoomInfo is a data provider; Clay is a workflow automation platform that can pull from ZoomInfo (and 50+ other providers) as one of its sources. Teams often use Clay to waterfall across ZoomInfo, Apollo, Clearbit, and others — getting the best data from each."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is better for large enterprise teams?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "ZoomInfo is better suited for large enterprise teams that need a single managed data contract, org chart data, and intent signals. Clay requires more technical setup and is better for RevOps-led teams that want to build custom enrichment logic."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can Clay access ZoomInfo data?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, Clay has a native ZoomInfo integration. If your company has a ZoomInfo contract, you can use it as a data source within Clay workflows alongside other providers."}}
