Saleshandy is better for teams that prioritize cost efficiency and volume, especially agencies managing multiple client domains who benefit from unlimited email accounts at a flat price."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is cheaper, Lemlist or Saleshandy?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Saleshandy is significantly cheaper. Saleshandy starts at $36/month flat (not per user) with unlimited email accounts. Lemlist starts at $55/user/month. For a team of 3 SDRs, Saleshandy costs $36–$99/month while Lemlist costs $165–$297/month. Saleshandy is the clear winner on price for agencies and larger teams."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Lemlist have LinkedIn automation that Saleshandy lacks?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. Lemlist includes LinkedIn automation (connection requests, messages, profile visits) as part of its multi-channel sequences. Saleshandy is email-only and does not have LinkedIn or phone automation. However, LinkedIn automation violates LinkedIn's Terms of Service and carries account restriction risk."}}

                        <h2>The Core Trade-Off: Quality vs Cost</h2>
                        <p>Lemlist and Saleshandy represent two distinct philosophies in cold email. Lemlist is built around the premise that personalization drives reply rates — and that higher reply rates justify a higher per-user price. Saleshandy is built around the premise that unlimited accounts at the lowest cost is the right foundation for high-volume outbound.</p>
                        <p>Both are correct, for different use cases. A solo founder or a 2-person SDR team running 200 highly personalized emails per week will likely get better results from Lemlist. An agency managing cold email campaigns for 10 clients across 30 domains will almost certainly get better economics from Saleshandy.</p>

                        <h2>Where Each Tool Breaks</h2>
                        <p><strong>Lemlist breaks</strong> when team size grows. At 5+ SDRs, the per-user cost ($495+/month) exceeds what most SMBs budget for cold email. The LinkedIn automation also carries account restriction risk from LinkedIn's ToS enforcement.</p>
                        <p><strong>Saleshandy breaks</strong> when personalization is the priority. It has no personalized image capability, no AI icebreaker generation, and no LinkedIn or phone automation. For campaigns targeting senior buyers who receive dozens of cold emails daily, Saleshandy's output blends in rather than standing out.</p>
