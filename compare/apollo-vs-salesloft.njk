<!-- Section 4: Who Should Choose Each -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>Who Should Choose Apollo.io?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Individual SDRs and small teams (1–15 reps) who need prospecting + sequencing in one tool</li>
    <li>Teams where the contact database is a primary need and paying separately for data is not justified</li>
    <li>Organizations new to outbound who want to start quickly without a complex setup</li>
    <li>Budget-conscious buyers where the $25–$50/user/month difference is material</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Should Choose Salesloft?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mid-market teams (15–100 reps) with existing data sources (ZoomInfo, Apollo) who need deeper engagement</li>
    <li>Sales managers who need team-level analytics, coaching tools, and performance dashboards</li>
    <li>Organizations that use conversation intelligence and deal management alongside cadences</li>
    <li>Teams that have outgrown Apollo's sequence depth and need more sophisticated workflow automation</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- Section 5: The Verdict -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>The Verdict: Start with Apollo, Graduate to Salesloft</h2>
  <p>For most teams evaluating Apollo versus Salesloft, the decision is primarily about team size and stage. Apollo is the better starting point: it is cheaper, easier to adopt, includes a contact database, and has a higher rep-level satisfaction score on G2. For individual SDRs and teams under 15 reps, Apollo covers the full workflow without the overhead of a dedicated RevOps setup.</p>
  <p>Salesloft becomes the better choice as teams scale past 15–20 reps and the need for team-level analytics, coaching, and more sophisticated workflow automation outweighs the cost premium. The "Apollo to Salesloft" progression is common enough that Salesloft's onboarding team has a well-worn path for it.</p>
  <p>The one scenario where Salesloft wins even for smaller teams: when conversation intelligence and deal management are critical requirements from day one. Salesloft's Drift integration and deal features are meaningfully better than Apollo's in those areas.</p>
