            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Vidyard or Loom better for sales outreach?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Vidyard is purpose-built for sales — it includes CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach), viewer analytics showing who watched and for how long, and a sales-specific Chrome extension. Loom is a general-purpose async video tool that lacks the sales-specific analytics and CRM integrations."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Loom integrate with Salesforce?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Loom has limited Salesforce integration compared to Vidyard. Vidyard's Salesforce integration logs video views as activities, tracks engagement per contact, and surfaces this data in the CRM. Loom's Salesforce integration is primarily for sharing links, not tracking engagement."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is cheaper?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Loom's Starter plan is $12.50/mo vs Vidyard's $19/mo. Both have free tiers. For teams that only need basic async video without sales-specific analytics, Loom's lower price point is attractive. For sales teams that need CRM-integrated view tracking, Vidyard's premium is justified."}}
