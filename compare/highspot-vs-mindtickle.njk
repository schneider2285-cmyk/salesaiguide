            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Highspot or MindTickle better for sales onboarding?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "MindTickle is more focused on structured onboarding and certification. Its Mission feature for practice pitches and AI-scored role plays is specifically designed for onboarding new reps. Highspot covers onboarding but is more balanced between content management and readiness."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which has better AI features?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Both have AI features, but they serve different purposes. MindTickle's Call AI scores recorded calls against custom rubrics. Highspot's Copilot AI recommends relevant content based on deal stage and buyer persona. The better choice depends on whether your priority is coaching or content recommendations."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can a team use both Highspot and MindTickle?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Some large enterprises use both — Highspot for content management and Seismic-style governance, MindTickle for structured coaching and certification. This is expensive and typically only justified at 200+ rep scale where the two use cases are clearly separated."}}
