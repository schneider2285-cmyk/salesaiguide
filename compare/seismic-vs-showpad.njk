            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Seismic or Showpad easier to implement?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Showpad is generally faster to implement. Seismic's full deployment typically takes 3-6 months with dedicated implementation resources. Showpad can be operational in 4-8 weeks for mid-market teams. The tradeoff is that Seismic's governance and compliance features are more robust at scale."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Which is better for regulated industries?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Seismic is the stronger choice for regulated industries (financial services, healthcare, pharma). Its content compliance controls, audit trails, and approval workflows are purpose-built for environments where content accuracy is a legal requirement."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do Seismic and Showpad compete on price?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Both are enterprise-only with custom pricing. Showpad is generally positioned as more accessible for mid-market ($500-1,000/seat/year range), while Seismic targets large enterprise with higher price points. Neither publishes pricing publicly."}}
