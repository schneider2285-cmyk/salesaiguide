  <p class="compare-note">Both tools require custom quotes. Artisan's ROI case is strongest when compared against the fully-loaded cost of an SDR hire. Regie.ai's ROI case depends on your existing team size — the more SDRs you have, the better the per-seat math.</p>

<!-- Section 4: Who Should Choose Each -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>Who Should Choose Artisan?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>SMB and mid-market companies without dedicated SDRs who want AI to run outbound autonomously</li>
    <li>Founders or small sales teams (1-5 reps) looking to generate pipeline without hiring</li>
    <li>Teams with a clear ICP and proven messaging who want to scale volume</li>
    <li>Companies willing to accept some loss of personalization control in exchange for automation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Should Choose Regie.ai?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enterprise and mid-market teams with 5+ SDRs who want to make existing reps more productive</li>
    <li>RevOps leaders looking to consolidate sequence management and content governance</li>
    <li>Teams that need enterprise compliance (SOC 2, SSO, GDPR) from their sales engagement vendor</li>
    <li>Organizations where brand voice and message quality control are non-negotiable</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- Section 5: The Core Trade-off -->
<section class="compare-section">
  <h2>The Core Trade-off: Autonomous vs Assisted</h2>
  <p>The fundamental question when choosing between Artisan and Regie.ai is not which tool has better features — it is what role you want AI to play in your outbound motion.</p>
  <p>Artisan bets on full autonomy: Ava, the AI SDR agent, handles prospecting, research, personalization, and outreach with minimal human oversight. This is powerful if it works, but it means accepting that AI is making judgment calls about who to contact and what to say. With only 19 G2 reviews as of early 2026, the evidence base for Artisan's real-world performance is still thin.</p>
  <p>Regie.ai bets on augmentation: human SDRs stay in control, but AI dramatically accelerates every step — writing sequences, researching prospects, suggesting next actions. The 345 G2 reviews and 4.4/5 rating suggest this approach has earned meaningful customer trust. The trade-off is that you still need SDRs to operate the platform.</p>
  <p>If your constraint is headcount, Artisan is the more direct solution. If your constraint is SDR productivity and you already have the team, Regie.ai is the stronger bet.</p>
