            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does HubSpot have meeting scheduling like Chili Piper?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "HubSpot includes a meetings tool that allows prospects to book time directly from a link. Chili Piper's Concierge product goes further — it routes inbound form submissions to the right rep in real time and books the meeting instantly, reducing time-to-meeting from hours to seconds."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Is Chili Piper worth the cost if I already have HubSpot?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "For teams with significant inbound volume (100+ form fills/month), Chili Piper's instant routing typically improves lead-to-meeting conversion rates enough to justify the additional cost. For teams with low inbound volume, HubSpot's built-in scheduling is sufficient."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Does Chili Piper integrate with HubSpot?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, Chili Piper has a deep HubSpot integration. It reads HubSpot form submissions, applies routing logic, and writes meeting data back to HubSpot contacts and deals. This is one of Chili Piper's most common deployment patterns."}}
