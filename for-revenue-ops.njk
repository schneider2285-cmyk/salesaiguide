## The RevOps Toolkit

Revenue Operations teams are responsible for the data infrastructure, tooling decisions, and process architecture that the entire GTM team runs on. RevOps buys tools that reps and managers use — which means the evaluation criteria are different: data quality, CRM integration depth, API access, and total cost of ownership matter more than ease of individual use.

### What to Look For

RevOps-oriented tools have high Org Scores and typically carry `Requires Admin` tags. The key evaluation criteria are: data accuracy and coverage (especially for enrichment tools), CRM integration quality (bidirectional sync, field mapping, deduplication), API access for custom workflows, and pricing model (per-seat vs. per-record vs. flat fee).

### Top 5 Tools for RevOps

**1. Clay — Multi-Source Data Enrichment (Org Score: 73)**

Clay is the most flexible enrichment tool available. It aggregates data from 50+ providers — including Apollo, ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Hunter, and LinkedIn — into a single spreadsheet-style interface, using a credit system that lets teams pay only for the data they actually use. RevOps teams use Clay to build enrichment waterfalls (try Provider A, fall back to Provider B if no result), automate lead routing, and power AI-personalized outreach at scale. Starting at $149/month; enterprise pricing available.

**2. ZoomInfo — Contact Database + Intent Data (Org Score: 77)**

ZoomInfo is the highest Org Score tool in our dataset and the most widely deployed data platform for enterprise GTM teams. It provides a 300M+ contact database, technographic data, intent signals (companies researching specific topics), and org chart data. RevOps teams use ZoomInfo as the primary data source for ICP targeting, territory planning, and TAM analysis. Custom pricing (typically $15,000–$30,000/year). Requires procurement and IT.

**3. Apollo.io — Enrichment + Engagement (Org Score: 68)**

Apollo is the most cost-effective option for RevOps teams at companies that cannot justify ZoomInfo pricing. The database is smaller (275M contacts vs. ZoomInfo's 300M+) and data quality is lower for enterprise contacts, but Apollo's API access, CRM integrations, and built-in sequence engine make it a strong all-in-one option for SMB and mid-market RevOps. Starting at $49/month; team plans available.

**4. HubSpot — CRM Infrastructure (Org Score: 74)**

For RevOps teams at companies not on Salesforce, HubSpot provides the CRM infrastructure that everything else plugs into. The Operations Hub tier adds data sync, programmable automation, and data quality tools (deduplication, field normalization). RevOps teams use HubSpot as the system of record for pipeline data, forecasting, and GTM reporting. Professional tier starts at $800/month for the full Operations Hub.

**5. Gong — Revenue Intelligence (Org Score: 78)**

For RevOps teams responsible for forecast accuracy, Gong's revenue intelligence layer is the most valuable add-on to a CRM. Gong analyzes conversation data to surface deal risks, forecast gaps, and pipeline health signals that CRM data alone cannot provide. RevOps teams use Gong's API to pull deal intelligence into BI tools and build custom forecasting models. Custom pricing.
