For teams that use HubSpot primarily as a sales CRM (not for marketing), Apollo is a viable alternative. For teams that use HubSpot's full marketing + sales suite, Apollo is not a replacement."}}

<div class="guide-main-content">

<p class="guide-intro">HubSpot Sales Hub is the most popular CRM for SMBs and mid-market teams. Its combination of free CRM, marketing automation, and sales engagement tools makes it the default choice for teams that want a unified platform. But HubSpot is not always the right choice — it is expensive at scale, limited for complex enterprise workflows, and overkill for teams that only need a simple pipeline CRM. Here are the 6 best alternatives, ranked by use case.</p>

    <div>
      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#1 Best for Enterprise Teams</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Salesforce Sales Cloud</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">The enterprise CRM standard — deeper customization, stronger integrations, higher complexity</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Salesforce is the right HubSpot alternative for enterprise teams that have hit HubSpot's customization limits. HubSpot is excellent for SMBs and mid-market teams, but its workflow automation, custom object support, and reporting depth are constrained compared to Salesforce at the enterprise tier. Teams with complex sales processes, large deal volumes, and dedicated Salesforce admins consistently find that Salesforce's flexibility justifies its higher complexity and cost.</p>
    <p>Salesforce Sales Cloud starts at $25/user/month (Starter) but enterprise deployments typically cost $150–300/user/month with add-ons. Implementation requires a Salesforce admin or partner, and the total cost of ownership (including admin time and customization) is significantly higher than HubSpot. The migration from HubSpot to Salesforce is complex and should not be undertaken without a clear business case.</p>
    <h4>Choose Salesforce over HubSpot if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You have 50+ seats and complex sales processes that require deep customization</li>
      <li>You need custom objects, advanced workflow automation, or complex reporting</li>
      <li>You have a dedicated Salesforce admin or plan to hire one</li>
      <li>Your enterprise buyers require Salesforce for procurement or integration reasons</li>

      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Pipedrive</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">The simplest pipeline CRM — best for teams that want deal management without HubSpot's complexity</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Pipedrive is the best HubSpot alternative for teams that want a simple, pipeline-focused CRM without HubSpot's marketing automation and platform complexity. At $14.90–49.90/user/month, Pipedrive is significantly cheaper than HubSpot Professional ($90/user/month) and delivers a cleaner, more intuitive pipeline management experience. For sales-only teams that do not need HubSpot's marketing features, Pipedrive's simplicity is a genuine advantage.</p>
    <p>Pipedrive lacks HubSpot's marketing automation, website tracking, form capture, and reporting depth. It is a sales CRM, not a unified marketing + sales platform. But for teams that use HubSpot primarily for deal tracking and email sequences — and not for marketing — Pipedrive delivers the core functionality at a fraction of the cost.</p>
    <h4>Choose Pipedrive over HubSpot if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You only need sales CRM functionality, not marketing automation</li>
      <li>Your team has fewer than 20 seats and budget is a constraint</li>
      <li>You want the simplest possible pipeline management experience</li>

      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#3 Best with Built-in Prospecting Data</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Apollo.io</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">CRM + prospecting data + sequences in one — best for teams that need data alongside deal management</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Apollo.io is the best HubSpot alternative for teams that need both CRM functionality and prospecting data in a single tool. HubSpot does not include a contact database — you need a separate Apollo, ZoomInfo, or Cognism subscription to source new contacts. Apollo includes a 275M+ contact database, email sequences, a dialer, and basic CRM functionality in a single platform at $49–99/user/month.</p>
    <p>Apollo's CRM is less mature than HubSpot's — it lacks HubSpot's marketing automation, website tracking, and reporting depth. But for sales-only teams that primarily need prospecting data and deal tracking, Apollo's all-in-one approach eliminates the need for a separate data subscription and simplifies the stack.</p>
    <h4>Choose Apollo over HubSpot if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You need prospecting data alongside CRM and want to avoid a separate data subscription</li>
      <li>Your team is sales-only and does not need marketing automation</li>
      <li>You want email sequences and a dialer built into your CRM</li>

      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#4 Best Enterprise SEP Add-on</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Outreach</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Enterprise sales engagement on top of HubSpot CRM — best when HubSpot sequences are not enough</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Outreach is the best option for teams that want to keep HubSpot as their CRM but need more powerful sales engagement than HubSpot's built-in sequences. HubSpot's sequences are functional for simple workflows, but they lack Outreach's advanced branching logic, AI deal intelligence, and deep Salesforce-style workflow automation. For enterprise teams with dedicated SDR teams running complex multi-step sequences, Outreach on top of HubSpot is a common configuration.</p>
    <p>This is not a replacement scenario — it is an augmentation. You keep HubSpot for CRM and marketing, and add Outreach for SDR sequencing and engagement. The combined cost ($90/user/month for HubSpot + $100/user/month for Outreach) is significant, but for enterprise teams where SDR productivity is the bottleneck, the investment is justified.</p>
    <h4>Choose Outreach alongside HubSpot if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>HubSpot's sequences are too limited for your SDR team's workflow complexity</li>
      <li>You have a dedicated SDR team running high-volume outbound sequences</li>
      <li>You want AI deal intelligence and pipeline forecasting that HubSpot lacks</li>

      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Regie.ai</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">AI-native sales engagement — best when AI content generation is the priority over CRM depth</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Regie.ai is the best HubSpot alternative for teams that want AI-native sales engagement rather than a traditional CRM. It integrates with HubSpot (and Salesforce) as a SEP layer, adding AI-generated sequences, prospecting agents, and content governance on top of your existing CRM. For teams that want the most modern AI-first approach to outbound, Regie.ai's architecture is more forward-looking than HubSpot's bolted-on AI features.</p>
    <h4>Choose Regie.ai alongside or instead of HubSpot if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>AI content generation and sequence optimization are your primary priorities</li>
      <li>You want content governance — centralized approved messaging for your SDR team</li>
      <li>You are building a new outbound motion and want to start AI-native</li>

      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#6 Best Free Alternative</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">HubSpot Free CRM</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">HubSpot's own free tier — genuinely capable for teams under 5 seats with basic needs</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Before paying for HubSpot Sales Hub Professional ($90/user/month), it is worth evaluating whether HubSpot's free CRM tier meets your needs. The free tier includes unlimited contacts, deal pipeline management, basic email tracking, meeting scheduling, and live chat. For teams under 5 seats with simple sales processes, the free tier is often sufficient and the upgrade to Professional is not justified.</p>
    <p>The free tier's limitations become constraints as teams grow: no sequences, no advanced reporting, no custom properties beyond a basic set, and no automation. But as a starting point for early-stage teams evaluating CRM options, HubSpot's free tier is the obvious first step before committing to any paid platform.</p>
