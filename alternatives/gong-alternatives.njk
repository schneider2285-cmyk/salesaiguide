<div class="guide-main-content">

<p class="guide-intro">Gong is the market leader in conversation intelligence and revenue intelligence. At approximately $1,400–1,600/user/year (plus a $5,000 platform fee), it is one of the most expensive tools in the sales tech stack. For teams that use it fully — call recording, deal intelligence, pipeline forecasting, and rep coaching — the ROI is well-documented. But Gong is overkill for many teams, and several alternatives deliver comparable value at a lower price or are better for specific use cases.</p>

<h2>The 6 Best Gong Alternatives</h2>

<div class="guide-tool-card">
  <div class="guide-tool-header">
    <div>
      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#1 Best for Revenue Forecasting</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Clari</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">AI-powered revenue forecasting and pipeline management — stronger than Gong for forecast accuracy</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Clari is the best Gong alternative for teams where revenue forecasting accuracy is the primary priority. While Gong has added forecasting features, Clari was built as a forecasting platform from the start — its AI models for pipeline risk, deal health, and revenue prediction are more mature than Gong's. Enterprise revenue teams that have tried both consistently rate Clari's forecasting as more accurate and its pipeline management workflow as more intuitive for VPs of Sales and CROs.</p>
    <p>Clari's conversation intelligence (call recording and transcription) is less advanced than Gong's. For teams that need both forecasting and conversation intelligence at the highest level, many enterprise organizations use both Clari and Gong. For teams that must choose one, the decision comes down to whether forecasting or call intelligence is the higher priority.</p>
    <h4>Choose Clari over Gong if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Revenue forecasting accuracy is your primary priority</li>
      <li>Your VP of Sales or CRO needs better pipeline visibility and deal risk alerts</li>
      <li>You want AI-powered deal health scoring integrated with your CRM forecast</li>

      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#2 Best for Sales Enablement + Coaching</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Mindtickle</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Sales readiness and coaching platform — better than Gong when onboarding and rep development are the priority</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Mindtickle is the best Gong alternative when sales enablement and rep development are the primary use case. Gong's coaching features are strong for call analysis, but Mindtickle's platform is purpose-built for the full rep development lifecycle — onboarding, certification, ongoing coaching, and performance tracking. For revenue enablement teams that need to manage rep readiness at scale, Mindtickle's structured learning paths and certification workflows are more comprehensive than Gong's.</p>
    <p>Mindtickle includes call recording and AI coaching analysis (through its Mindtickle Call AI product), so it covers the core Gong use case while adding the enablement layer. For teams that currently use Gong primarily for coaching and are also paying for a separate LMS or enablement platform, Mindtickle can consolidate both into a single subscription.</p>
    <h4>Choose Mindtickle over Gong if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Sales onboarding, certification, and rep readiness are your primary priorities</li>
      <li>You are paying for both a conversation intelligence tool and a separate LMS</li>
      <li>You have a large sales team (50+) where structured rep development programs are needed</li>

      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#3 Best if You Already Use Salesloft</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Salesloft Conversations</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Conversation intelligence bundled into Salesloft — eliminates a separate Gong subscription for Salesloft users</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Salesloft includes conversation intelligence (call recording, transcription, and AI analysis) natively in its platform. For teams already paying for Salesloft, adding Gong on top means paying twice for overlapping functionality. Salesloft's conversation intelligence is less advanced than Gong's — its AI deal intelligence and pipeline forecasting are not as deep — but for most mid-market teams, the built-in Salesloft capability is sufficient and the cost savings from eliminating Gong are significant.</p>
    <p>The typical scenario for switching from Gong to Salesloft Conversations is a team that uses Salesloft as their primary SEP and is evaluating whether Gong's incremental value justifies $1,400+/user/year on top of their existing Salesloft subscription. For most teams under 50 seats, it does not.</p>
    <h4>Choose Salesloft Conversations over Gong if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You already use Salesloft and want to eliminate a separate Gong subscription</li>
      <li>Your conversation intelligence needs are primarily call recording and basic coaching</li>
      <li>You do not need Gong's advanced deal intelligence or pipeline forecasting</li>

      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#4 Best for Content + Coaching Combined</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Highspot</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Sales enablement platform with coaching and content in one — best when content governance is as important as call intelligence</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Highspot is the best Gong alternative for teams that need both content management and coaching in a single platform. Gong is strong on call intelligence but does not manage sales content (pitch decks, case studies, battle cards). Highspot combines content management, buyer engagement analytics, and coaching in one platform. For revenue enablement teams managing both content and rep development, Highspot's consolidation can eliminate both a separate Gong subscription and a separate content management tool.</p>
    <p>Highspot's call intelligence is less advanced than Gong's, but its content analytics — tracking which content is used in deals, which content correlates with wins, and which reps are using approved materials — are more advanced than anything Gong offers. For teams where content governance is a priority alongside coaching, Highspot is the stronger choice.</p>
    <h4>Choose Highspot over Gong if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Content management and governance are as important as call intelligence</li>
      <li>You are currently paying for both a content management tool and Gong separately</li>
      <li>You want to track which content is used in deals and correlate it with win rates</li>

      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Fireflies.ai</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Free call recording and transcription — the right choice when basic functionality is all you need</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Fireflies.ai is the best budget alternative to Gong for teams that primarily need call recording and searchable transcripts without Gong's advanced deal intelligence. Its free tier includes unlimited call recording, AI-generated transcripts, and basic search. Paid plans start at $10/user/month. For a 10-person team, Fireflies costs $1,200/year versus Gong's $14,000–16,000/year — a saving of $12,000–14,000/year.</p>
    <p>Fireflies lacks Gong's deal intelligence, pipeline forecasting, and advanced coaching analytics. It is a call recording and transcription tool, not a revenue intelligence platform. But for teams that primarily use Gong for recording calls and searching transcripts — and not for the advanced AI features — Fireflies delivers the core functionality at a fraction of the cost.</p>
    <h4>Choose Fireflies over Gong if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You primarily need call recording and searchable transcripts, not deal intelligence</li>
      <li>Your team has fewer than 10 seats and Gong's $5K platform fee is not justified</li>
      <li>Budget is the primary constraint and you can live without advanced AI features</li>
    </ul>

      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#6 Best if You Already Use ZoomInfo</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Chorus (ZoomInfo Conversation Intelligence)</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Bundled with ZoomInfo — lower incremental cost for teams already on the ZoomInfo platform</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Chorus was acquired by ZoomInfo in 2021 and is now sold as ZoomInfo Conversation Intelligence. For teams already on ZoomInfo, Chorus can be added at a lower incremental cost than a separate Gong subscription. Its integration with ZoomInfo's contact and account data is a genuine differentiator — it can automatically enrich call participants with ZoomInfo data and surface account intelligence during calls.</p>
    <p>Chorus's AI features are less advanced than Gong's, and its standalone value without ZoomInfo is limited. It is best evaluated as a ZoomInfo bundle add-on rather than as a standalone Gong replacement. For teams not on ZoomInfo, Gong, Clari, or Salesloft Conversations are better choices.</p>
    <h4>Choose Chorus over Gong if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You are already on ZoomInfo and want conversation intelligence at a lower incremental cost</li>
      <li>ZoomInfo data integration in your call recordings is a priority</li>
