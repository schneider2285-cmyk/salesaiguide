<p class="guide-intro">ZoomInfo is the most comprehensive B2B data platform available, but it is also one of the most expensive. At $15,000–$50,000+/year for a team of 5–10, it is out of reach for most SMBs and many mid-market teams. And even for teams that can afford it, ZoomInfo is not always the right choice — Cognism is better for EMEA, Clay is better for custom enrichment, and Apollo delivers 80% of the value at 10–20% of the cost for most use cases.</p>

<p>This guide covers the 7 best ZoomInfo alternatives, ranked by use case. We have reviewed each tool independently and pulled G2 data as of February 2026.</p>

      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#1 Best Budget Alternative</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Apollo.io</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">275M+ contacts, built-in sequencing, and a dialer — at 10–20% of ZoomInfo's cost</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Apollo.io is the most common ZoomInfo alternative for SMB and mid-market teams. Its 275M+ contact database covers most of the same accounts as ZoomInfo, and its built-in sequencing and dialer mean you do not need a separate SEP subscription. For a team of 5, Apollo costs $2,940–5,940/year versus ZoomInfo's $15,000–25,000/year — a saving of $10,000–20,000/year.</p>
    <p>Apollo's data quality is good but not ZoomInfo-grade. Its enterprise account coverage has more gaps, its intent data is less comprehensive, and its Salesforce integration is less bi-directional. For teams with large enterprise TAMs and dedicated RevOps resources, ZoomInfo's accuracy premium is worth paying. For most other teams, Apollo's data is sufficient and the cost savings are significant.</p>
    <h4>Choose Apollo over ZoomInfo if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Your team has fewer than 20 seats and budget is a constraint</li>
      <li>You want prospecting data and email sequencing in a single tool</li>
      <li>Your TAM is SMB or mid-market where Apollo's data quality is sufficient</li>
    </ul>

      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Cognism</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">GDPR-native B2B data with the strongest EMEA coverage — the right choice for European markets</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Cognism is the best ZoomInfo alternative for teams prospecting in Europe. ZoomInfo's EMEA data is noticeably weaker than its North American data — coverage gaps, stale mobile numbers, and limited GDPR compliance tooling are consistent complaints in G2 reviews from European users. Cognism was built for EMEA from the start: it maintains verified opt-out lists for the UK, Germany, and other European markets, and its Diamond Data tier claims 98% mobile number accuracy for European contacts.</p>
    <p>Cognism's pricing is comparable to ZoomInfo (custom, typically $15K+/year), so it is not a budget alternative. It is a quality alternative for teams where EMEA coverage and GDPR compliance are the primary requirements.</p>
    <h4>Choose Cognism over ZoomInfo if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Your primary market is the UK, DACH, Nordics, or other European regions</li>
      <li>GDPR compliance with verified opt-out lists is a legal requirement</li>
      <li>Mobile number accuracy for European contacts is critical for your calling motion</li>

      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#3 Best for Custom Enrichment</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Clay</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Multi-source enrichment from 75+ providers — the power tool for teams that need more than any single database</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Clay is the right ZoomInfo alternative for teams that need enrichment from multiple data sources rather than a single database. Clay aggregates 75+ data providers — including ZoomInfo itself, Apollo, Clearbit, Hunter, and LinkedIn — and lets you build custom enrichment workflows that pull the best data from each source. A typical Clay workflow might use Apollo for email data, Clearbit for firmographic data, and LinkedIn for role verification — combining sources that no single provider can match.</p>
    <p>Clay requires RevOps or technical resources to build and maintain workflows. It is not a simple plug-and-play replacement for ZoomInfo. But for teams that have hit ZoomInfo's data quality ceiling for their specific ICP, Clay's multi-source approach often delivers better results.</p>
    <h4>Choose Clay over ZoomInfo if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You need enrichment from multiple data sources that no single provider covers</li>
      <li>You have RevOps or technical resources to build custom enrichment workflows</li>
      <li>You want AI-generated personalization at scale alongside data enrichment</li>

      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Lusha</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Direct dial and mobile number specialist — strong data quality at $36–69/user/month</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Lusha is the best ZoomInfo alternative for teams that primarily need direct dials and mobile numbers at a budget price. At $36–69/user/month, Lusha is dramatically cheaper than ZoomInfo while maintaining strong data quality for direct contact information. Its Chrome extension integrates with LinkedIn for real-time contact capture, and its API allows CRM enrichment without a full platform subscription.</p>
    <p>Lusha's database is smaller than ZoomInfo's (100M+ contacts vs ZoomInfo's 321M+), and it lacks ZoomInfo's intent data, technographic data, and advanced workflow features. It is a data tool, not a full sales intelligence platform. But for teams whose primary use case is finding direct dials for cold calling, Lusha delivers comparable data quality to ZoomInfo at a fraction of the cost.</p>
    <h4>Choose Lusha over ZoomInfo if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Direct dials and mobile numbers are your primary data need</li>
      <li>Your team has fewer than 10 seats and budget is a constraint</li>
      <li>You want a simple Chrome extension for LinkedIn prospecting without a full platform</li>

      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">LeadIQ</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Real-time LinkedIn data capture with CRM sync — the best tool for LinkedIn-first prospecting workflows</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>LeadIQ is the best ZoomInfo alternative for teams whose prospecting workflow starts on LinkedIn. Its Chrome extension captures contact data directly from LinkedIn profiles and company pages in real time, syncing automatically to Salesforce, HubSpot, or Outreach. For AEs and SDRs who spend significant time on LinkedIn, LeadIQ's workflow integration is more efficient than ZoomInfo's bulk export approach.</p>
    <p>LeadIQ's database is smaller than ZoomInfo's, and its data quality is lower for accounts not well-represented on LinkedIn. It is best for teams prospecting in tech, SaaS, and professional services where LinkedIn coverage is strong. For teams prospecting in manufacturing, healthcare, or other industries with lower LinkedIn penetration, ZoomInfo or Apollo will have better coverage.</p>
    <h4>Choose LeadIQ over ZoomInfo if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Your prospecting workflow is LinkedIn-first and you want real-time data capture</li>
      <li>You need seamless CRM sync from LinkedIn without manual data entry</li>
      <li>Your ICP is in tech, SaaS, or professional services where LinkedIn coverage is strong</li>

      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">6sense</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">AI-powered intent data and account prioritization — best for teams that want to focus on in-market accounts</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>6sense is the best alternative to ZoomInfo's intent data layer for enterprise teams. While ZoomInfo uses Bombora intent data as an add-on, 6sense has built its own proprietary intent data platform that tracks anonymous buying behavior across the web and maps it to specific accounts and buying stages. For enterprise teams with large TAMs, 6sense's account prioritization can significantly improve SDR efficiency by focusing outreach on accounts showing active buying signals.</p>
    <p>6sense is not a ZoomInfo replacement — it does not have ZoomInfo's contact database depth. It is a complementary tool for teams that already have a data source and want to add intent-driven prioritization on top. Pricing is enterprise-tier (typically $60K+/year), making it appropriate only for large sales teams.</p>
    <h4>Choose 6sense over ZoomInfo if:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Intent data and account prioritization are your primary requirements</li>
      <li>You have a large enterprise TAM and need to focus SDR effort on in-market accounts</li>
      <li>You already have a contact data source and want to add intent on top</li>

      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Apollo.io Free Tier</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">50 email credits/month, unlimited sequences, and a dialer — genuinely useful for early-stage teams</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Apollo's free tier is the best free ZoomInfo alternative. It includes 50 email credits per month, unlimited email sequences, basic CRM integration, and access to the full 275M+ contact database for search (with credits required to export). For early-stage startups and founders doing their own prospecting, Apollo's free tier provides enough functionality to run a basic outbound motion without any subscription cost.</p>
    <p>The 50 credit/month limit is the primary constraint. For teams sending more than 50 personalized emails per month, a paid Apollo plan ($49/user/month) or a dedicated cold email tool (Instantly, Smartlead) will be necessary. But as a starting point for teams evaluating whether outbound is worth investing in, Apollo's free tier is the obvious first step.</p>
