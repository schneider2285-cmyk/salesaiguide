                    <h2>How Tools Are Selected</h2>
                    <p>Every tool listed on Sales AI Guide must meet four criteria before we include it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Active product</strong> &mdash; The tool must be currently available and actively maintained. We don't list discontinued products, vaporware, or tools in closed beta with no public access.</li>
                        <li><strong>B2B sales focus</strong> &mdash; The tool must serve a B2B sales use case: prospecting, outreach, conversation intelligence, CRM, pipeline management, data enrichment, or sales engagement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Public review data</strong> &mdash; The tool must have reviews on at least one major review platform (G2, Capterra, or TrustRadius). We don't list tools with zero public reviews.</li>
                        <li><strong>AI component</strong> &mdash; The tool must include an AI-powered feature as part of its core product&mdash;whether that's AI-driven email writing, conversation analysis, predictive scoring, or intelligent automation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If a tool meets all four criteria, it's eligible for inclusion. We don't charge for listings and we don't exclude tools based on whether they offer an affiliate program.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
                    <p>We aggregate data from multiple public sources. Here's what we pull from each:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>G2</strong> &mdash; Star ratings, review counts, category rankings, and reviewer sentiment themes (common praise and criticism). G2 is our primary rating source because it has the largest volume of verified B2B software reviews.</li>
                        <li><strong>Capterra</strong> &mdash; Supplementary ratings, review counts, and feature-level scoring. Used as a cross-reference to validate G2 data and to cover tools with smaller G2 presence.</li>
                        <li><strong>TrustRadius</strong> &mdash; In-depth reviewer pros/cons and trScore ratings. Particularly useful for enterprise tools where TrustRadius often has more detailed reviews.</li>
                        <li><strong>Product Hunt</strong> &mdash; Launch data, upvote counts, and community sentiment. Primarily used for newer tools that haven't yet accumulated significant reviews on G2 or Capterra.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vendor websites</strong> &mdash; Pricing tiers, feature lists, product descriptions, integration details, and free trial availability. We link to vendor sites so you can verify current pricing directly.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We check this data regularly but can't guarantee it's always current. Pricing changes, features get added, ratings shift. When in doubt, verify on the vendor's site directly.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Verification and Update Cadence</h2>
                    <p>We review and update tool profiles on a <strong>monthly cadence</strong>. During each update cycle, we check:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Current G2 ratings and review counts</li>
                        <li>Pricing changes on vendor websites</li>
                        <li>New features or product pivots</li>
                        <li>Tool availability (still active and accepting new customers)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each tool card and review page displays a <strong>"Verified" date</strong> indicating when the data was last confirmed. If you see a date more than 60 days old, the data may be stale&mdash;check the vendor's site for the latest information.</p>
                    <p>We prioritize updating the most-visited tool profiles first. Lower-traffic pages may take longer to refresh.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>"Best For" Designations</h2>
                    <p>You'll see "Best For" badges on tool cards throughout the site. Here's how we assign them:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Review platform positioning</strong> &mdash; We look at how tools are categorized and ranked on G2, Capterra, and TrustRadius. A tool that G2 ranks as a Leader in "Email Deliverability" informs our "Best For" designation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature differentiators</strong> &mdash; We identify what makes each tool distinct from competitors. If a tool's standout feature is unlimited email accounts at a low price point, we reflect that in the badge (e.g., "Best for high-volume cold email").</li>
                        <li><strong>Reviewer consensus</strong> &mdash; We read through review themes to understand what real users say the tool is best at. If reviewers consistently praise a tool for agency management, that shapes the designation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>"Best For" badges are editorial judgments based on aggregated data, not paid placements. No vendor can pay to receive or change a badge.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>AI-Assisted Content</h2>
                    <p>We use AI to help write and structure content on this site. Specifically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tool descriptions</strong> are written with AI assistance based on vendor documentation, official feature lists, and public product pages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Comparison summaries</strong> are AI-assisted, synthesizing data from multiple sources into structured, comparable formats.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pros and cons</strong> are extracted and summarized from public review platforms using AI to identify common themes across reviews.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We're transparent about this because we believe the value we provide is in <strong>organization and structure</strong>&mdash;putting scattered information into a useful, comparable format&mdash;not in claiming original firsthand experience with every tool.</p>
                    <p>All AI-generated content is reviewed by a human editor before publishing. We do not fabricate reviews, testimonials, or "hands-on" testing claims.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Affiliate Relationships</h2>
                    <p>This site earns revenue through <strong>affiliate links</strong>. When you click a link to a tool and sign up, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.</p>
                    <p>Affiliate links are formatted as: <code>/go/[toolname]</code></p>
                    <p>Important details about how we handle affiliate relationships:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We try to include affiliate links for <strong>every tool we list</strong>, not just the ones that pay the highest commissions.</li>
                        <li>Affiliate relationships do <strong>not</strong> influence tool rankings, ratings, "Best For" badges, or editorial content.</li>
                        <li>We list tools that don't have affiliate programs if they meet our selection criteria.</li>
                        <li>Our goal is to be a useful directory first. If the directory is useful, the affiliate revenue follows.</li>
                    </ul>
