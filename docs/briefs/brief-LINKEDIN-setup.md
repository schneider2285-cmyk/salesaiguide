# LinkedIn Company Page — Manus Handoff

## Context

Matt needs a LinkedIn Company Page for SalesAIGuide to establish brand presence, drive organic traffic, and build credibility with B2B sales professionals. This is a content handoff — Manus will create the page using these assets and begin posting.

**Matt must create the LinkedIn account first** (requires personal LinkedIn login + agreement to terms). Then Manus can manage content using these assets.

```

### About Section (2,000 characters max)

```
SalesAIGuide is the decision engine for AI-powered B2B sales tools.

The AI sales tool market has exploded — 500+ tools, endless "Top 10" listicles, and vendor marketing that all sounds the same. Sales professionals waste hours researching tools across G2, Reddit, YouTube, and vendor sites, only to end up more confused than when they started.

We fix that.

SalesAIGuide synthesizes evidence from 8 categories of public sources — G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, Reddit, LinkedIn communities, YouTube walkthroughs, vendor documentation, and job posting stack signals — into structured Decision Snapshots that answer the questions buyers actually ask before purchasing.

Every tool receives two composite scores: an Org Score (value for team buyers and managers) and a Rep Score (value for individual contributors). No other review site separates recommendations this clearly by who's actually buying.

What we cover:
→ 30+ reviewed AI sales tools across 14 categories
→ 31+ head-to-head comparison pages
→ Role-specific guides for Sales Reps, Sales Managers, and RevOps teams
→ Monthly data verification on every tool page
→ Categories: Cold Outreach, Lead Prospecting, Data Enrichment, Conversation Intelligence, Sales Engagement, CRM & Pipeline, AI SDRs, and more

What makes us different:
→ Dual Org/Rep scoring system — because a tool that's great for enterprise RevOps may be useless for an individual SDR
→ 8-source evidence synthesis — not vendor claims, not sponsored content
→ Transparent about affiliate relationships — they never affect scores or placement
→ AI-assisted research disclosed openly — we treat this as a trust signal, not something to hide

Built for sales professionals who need results, not hype.

## Part 3: Launch Posts (First 2 Weeks)

### Post 1 — Launch Announcement (Day 1)

```
We just launched SalesAIGuide — and here's why.

There are 500+ AI sales tools on the market right now.

Every week, a new "Top 10 AI Sales Tools" article gets published by someone who's never used any of them. They recycle vendor copy, slap affiliate links on everything, and call it a "review."

Meanwhile, sales reps and managers are spending hours bouncing between G2, Reddit, YouTube, and vendor sites trying to figure out which tools are actually worth their budget.

We built SalesAIGuide to fix this.

→ 30+ tools reviewed with evidence from 8 public sources
→ Every tool gets two scores: one for team buyers (Org Score), one for individual reps (Rep Score)
→ Head-to-head comparisons that actually compare something
→ Monthly data verification — no stale reviews

No pay-to-rank. No vendor BS. Just structured evidence so you can decide in minutes, not weeks.

### Post 2 — The "Problem" Post (Day 3)

```
The hardest part of buying an AI sales tool isn't finding one.

It's figuring out which one is actually right for YOUR situation.

A tool that's perfect for an enterprise RevOps team with 50 reps and a Salesforce instance? Probably overkill for an SDR spending $50/month out of pocket.

That's why we built a dual scoring system at SalesAIGuide:

📊 Org Score — How well does this tool serve team buyers? Enterprise fit, integration depth, scalability.

👤 Rep Score — How well does this tool serve individual contributors? Ease of adoption, pricing transparency, solo usability.

Same tool. Two very different answers depending on who's buying.

See the scores → salesaiguide.com

### Post 3 — Tool Spotlight: Clay (Day 5)

```
If you're in B2B sales and haven't looked at Clay yet, you're missing something.

We reviewed Clay across 8 evidence sources at SalesAIGuide, and here's what the data shows:

→ Highest overall scores in the Data Enrichment category
→ 80+ data provider integrations in a single platform
→ Waterfall enrichment that checks multiple sources automatically
→ The workflow builder is essentially a spreadsheet that can talk to the internet

Where it falls short: the learning curve is real. Power users love it. Casual users may find it overwhelming.

Full Decision Snapshot with Org Score, Rep Score, pricing breakdown, and "Who Should NOT Buy" section → salesaiguide.com/tools/clay/

### Post 4 — Comparison Post (Day 8)

```
Apollo vs. ZoomInfo — the comparison everyone asks about.

One costs $49/month. The other starts at $15,000/year.

Are you getting 25x the value? It depends entirely on who you are and what you need.

At SalesAIGuide, we break this down across 6 dimensions:
→ Enterprise Fit
→ Ease of Adoption
→ AI Depth
→ Integration Depth
→ Pricing Transparency
→ Scalability

The short version: if you're a single rep or small team, the answer is clear. If you're running RevOps at scale with compliance requirements, it's a different conversation.

### Post 5 — Role-Specific Guide (Day 10)

```
Sales reps: stop asking your manager which AI tools to buy.

We built a page specifically for individual contributors — tools you can buy, set up, and use today without waiting for IT approval or a procurement cycle.

Every tool on the list meets three criteria:
✅ Under $100/month
✅ Self-serve signup (no "book a demo" gatekeeping)
✅ Solo-usable (doesn't require a team deployment)

Categories covered:
→ Cold outreach
→ Lead prospecting
→ Email writing
→ Meeting scheduling
→ Call recording

```

### Post 6 — Transparency Post (Day 12)

```
Let's talk about how review sites actually make money.

Most AI tool "review" sites don't tell you this: their rankings are influenced by who pays the most. Higher commission = higher placement. That's the business model.

At SalesAIGuide, we use affiliate links. We're upfront about that. It's how the site stays free.

But here's what we committed to from day one:

→ Affiliate relationships never affect scores or placement
→ Every tool page shows a "Verified [Month]" timestamp
→ We publish a "Who Should NOT Buy" section on every review
→ Our evidence sources are listed — you can check our work

We'd rather recommend the right tool and earn nothing than recommend the wrong one and cash a check.
