<div class="guide-main-content">
<p class="guide-intro">Cold email for agencies is a different problem than cold email for a single rep. You're managing multiple client domains, multiple sending personas, multiple target audiences — and a deliverability issue on one client's campaign can't bleed into another's. The tool that works for a solo SDR often breaks at agency scale.</p>

<p>After evaluating the three leading cold email platforms on the dimensions that matter most for agencies — multi-client management, inbox isolation, white-labeling, and reporting — here's what we found.</p>

<h2>The Agency-Specific Requirements</h2>
<p>Before comparing tools, it's worth being explicit about what agencies actually need that solo users don't:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inbox isolation</strong> — a deliverability problem on Client A's campaign must not affect Client B's sending reputation</li>
  <li><strong>Sub-accounts or workspaces</strong> — each client should have their own environment with separate settings, sequences, and reporting</li>
  <li><strong>Master inbox</strong> — agency staff need to see all replies across all clients in one view without switching accounts</li>
  <li><strong>White-label reporting</strong> — clients want reports that look like they came from your agency, not from the tool vendor</li>
  <li><strong>Scalable pricing</strong> — per-seat pricing becomes expensive when you have 5 account managers handling 20 clients</li>
</ul>

<h2>Smartlead: Best Overall for Agencies</h2>

      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#1 for Agencies</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Smartlead</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Purpose-built for agencies with the strongest multi-client infrastructure</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Smartlead is the only tool in this comparison that was explicitly built with agencies in mind. Its sub-account architecture means each client gets a completely isolated environment — separate warmup pools, separate sending infrastructure, separate analytics. A deliverability issue in one sub-account cannot propagate to others.</p>
    <p>The master inbox is the standout feature: all replies from all client campaigns appear in a single unified view, with filters by client, campaign, and reply status. For an agency managing 15+ active campaigns, this alone saves hours per week.</p>
    <h4>Smartlead agency strengths:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>True sub-account isolation — the strongest inbox separation of the three tools</li>
      <li>White-label client reporting with your agency's branding</li>
      <li>Unlimited sending accounts at the Pro tier ($94/mo)</li>
      <li>API access for custom integrations and client portals</li>
      <li>Dedicated agency onboarding and support</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Smartlead limitations:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Less polished UI than Instantly — steeper learning curve for new team members</li>
      <li>Personalization features are less sophisticated than Lemlist</li>
      <li>Warmup network is smaller than Instantly's</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Instantly: Best Deliverability Infrastructure</h2>
<div class="guide-tool-card">
  <div class="guide-tool-header">
    <div>
      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#2 for Agencies</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Instantly</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Industry-leading deliverability with the largest warmup network</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Instantly's primary advantage is its warmup network — over 1 million real inboxes that participate in the Instantly warmup pool. For agencies where deliverability is the primary concern, this is a meaningful edge. Clients in competitive industries (finance, SaaS, recruiting) often see 10–15% better inbox placement rates on Instantly vs Smartlead.</p>
    <p>The Unibox (unified inbox) is comparable to Smartlead's master inbox, and the organization structure allows reasonable client separation. The main gap for agencies is white-label reporting — Instantly's client-facing reports are branded as Instantly, which some clients find unprofessional.</p>
    <h4>Instantly agency strengths:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Largest warmup network in the market — best deliverability baseline</li>
      <li>Unlimited sending accounts on all paid plans</li>
      <li>Clean, intuitive UI — easiest to onboard new team members</li>
      <li>Strong campaign analytics and A/B testing</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instantly limitations for agencies:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>No white-label reporting — a meaningful gap for client-facing agencies</li>
      <li>Organization structure is less isolated than Smartlead's sub-accounts</li>
      <li>No dedicated agency tier or pricing</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Lemlist: Best for Personalized Campaigns</h2>
<div class="guide-tool-card">
  <div class="guide-tool-header">
    <div>
      <div class="guide-tool-rank">#3 for Agencies</div>
      <h3 class="guide-tool-name">Lemlist</h3>
      <p class="guide-tool-tagline">Best personalization features, but weakest multi-client infrastructure</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="guide-tool-body">
    <p>Lemlist is the best tool in this comparison for personalized outreach — custom images, video thumbnails, and dynamic landing pages are genuinely differentiated features. For agencies whose clients need high-touch, personalized campaigns (executive outreach, enterprise ABM), Lemlist's personalization capabilities justify the higher price.</p>
    <p>However, Lemlist was not built for agencies managing multiple clients. There's no true sub-account architecture, no white-label reporting, and the sending account limits on lower plans are restrictive. It works for agencies with 3–5 clients but becomes difficult to manage at 10+.</p>
    <h4>Lemlist agency strengths:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Best personalization features — custom images, video, dynamic landing pages</li>
      <li>Multi-channel sequences (email + LinkedIn + calling)</li>
      <li>Strong template library for different industries</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Lemlist limitations for agencies:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>No sub-account architecture — client isolation is limited</li>
      <li>No white-label reporting</li>
      <li>Sending account limits on lower plans</li>
      <li>Most expensive of the three at scale</li>
    </ul>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>
<p>For most cold email agencies, <strong>Smartlead is the right choice</strong>. The sub-account isolation, white-label reporting, and master inbox are purpose-built for agency workflows in a way that Instantly and Lemlist are not.</p>
<p>Choose <strong>Instantly</strong> if deliverability is your primary differentiator and your clients don't care about white-label reporting. The warmup network advantage is real and measurable.</p>
<p>Choose <strong>Lemlist</strong> only if your agency specializes in high-touch, personalized enterprise outreach where the personalization features justify the trade-offs in multi-client management.</p>
