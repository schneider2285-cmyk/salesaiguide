## The Manager's Toolkit

Sales managers need different tools than reps. Where reps need self-serve tools they can use independently, managers need visibility: into rep activity, call quality, pipeline health, and forecast accuracy. The tools below are rated by **Org Score** (organizational value) — our measure of how much value a tool delivers at the team or company level.

### What to Look For

Manager-oriented tools tend to be higher cost (custom pricing or $100+/user/month), require admin setup, and deliver value through analytics dashboards, coaching workflows, and CRM integrations rather than individual productivity. The key question for managers is: does this tool give me signal I cannot get from my CRM alone?

### Top 5 Tools for Sales Managers

**1. Gong — Conversation Intelligence (Org Score: 78)**

Gong is the category leader for conversation intelligence. It records, transcribes, and analyzes every sales call, then surfaces coaching insights, deal risks, and forecast signals. Managers use Gong to review calls without listening to them in full, identify which reps need coaching on specific objection types, and track deal health based on conversation patterns. Custom pricing (typically $1,200–$1,600/user/year). Requires admin setup and CRM integration.

**2. Outreach — Sales Engagement Platform (Org Score: 73)**

Outreach is the most widely deployed sales engagement platform for mid-market and enterprise teams. Managers use it to build standardized sequences for the team, track sequence performance across reps, and enforce consistent outreach cadences. The analytics layer shows which sequences convert, which reps follow the playbook, and where deals stall. Custom pricing. Requires IT and CRM integration.

**3. Salesloft — Sales Engagement Alternative (Org Score: 70)**

Salesloft competes directly with Outreach and is often preferred by teams that prioritize coaching workflows over sequence analytics. The Coaching feature set is stronger than Outreach's equivalent. Custom pricing. Requires admin setup.

**4. HubSpot — CRM + Pipeline (Org Score: 74)**

For managers at companies without Salesforce, HubSpot's Sales Hub provides pipeline management, forecasting, and basic sequence tools in one platform. The Professional tier ($100/user/month) includes deal forecasting, pipeline automation, and team performance dashboards. Best for managers at SMBs who want a single platform rather than a CRM plus a separate engagement tool.

**5. ZoomInfo — Data Intelligence (Org Score: 77)**

ZoomInfo is the highest Org Score tool in our dataset. For managers building outbound teams, ZoomInfo provides the contact database, intent signals, and technographic data that power prospecting at scale. Custom pricing (typically $15,000–$30,000/year for a team). Best for managers at companies with dedicated SDR teams who need reliable data infrastructure.

### What to Avoid as a Manager

Tools with high Rep Scores but low Org Scores (Lavender, Instantly, Smartlead) are rep-level tools that managers should not try to standardize across a team. They are designed for individual use and do not provide the team-level analytics that managers need.

### Recommended Manager Stack by Team Size

| Team Size | Core Stack | Estimated Cost |
|---|---|---|
| 1–5 reps | HubSpot Sales Hub Pro + Apollo | ~$200–400/month |
| 5–20 reps | HubSpot + Gong + Outreach | $3,000–8,000/month |
| 20+ reps | Salesforce + Gong + Outreach + ZoomInfo | Custom |
