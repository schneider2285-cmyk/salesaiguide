- **Clay affiliate is live.** Every "Visit Clay" click tracks to `?via=matthew-schneider`.

## What Needs to Happen in the Next 30 Days

### Priority 1 — Affiliate Revenue (Matt)
Apply to Apollo, Instantly, and HubSpot affiliate programs. These three together could generate $50–100/conversion once traffic arrives. Apollo and Instantly have no prerequisites. HubSpot requires LinkedIn verification.

### Priority 2 — Indexing & First Rankings (Matt + Manus)
The 9 priority URLs were submitted to Search Console on Feb 24. Expect first impressions data within 1–2 weeks. First rankings typically appear within 4–8 weeks for low-competition long-tail keywords.

**Priority URLs submitted:**
1. /tools/clay-review.html
2. /tools/apollo-review.html
3. /compare/clay-vs-apollo.html
4. /compare/instantly-vs-smartlead.html
5. /guides/best-cold-email-tools.html
6. /guides/best-ai-sdr-tools.html
7. /categories/best-ai-prospecting-tools.html
8. /for-sales-reps/
9. /for-revenue-ops/

### Priority 3 — Gong Data Update (Manus → Claude Code)
Agent 2 flagged that Gong's G2 rating dropped from 4.8 → 4.7 and review count grew from 5,800 → 6,470. Brief Claude Code to update `_data/tools/gong.json` with the corrected values.

### Priority 4 — Phase 7 Content (Claude Code)
New Tool Scout identified Saleshandy and Lemlist as the highest-value additions. Both appear in competitor roundups for keywords we're targeting. Adding these two tools would:
- Unlock 4 new comparison pages (Saleshandy vs Instantly, Saleshandy vs Smartlead, Lemlist vs Instantly, Lemlist vs Smartlead)
- Strengthen the cold email category page
- Add 2 more affiliate revenue streams

### Priority 5 — `lastVerified` Data Quality (Claude Code)
All 10 original tool JSON files are missing `lastVerified` timestamps. This is a data quality issue that makes it harder for Agent 2 to track data freshness. Brief Claude Code to add `lastVerified: "2026-02-24"` to all tool JSON files.

## Competitive Threat
**marketbetter.ai** is the most active content competitor. They published 4 tool reviews in the past 2 weeks targeting the same keywords. Their content is AI-generated and lacks the structured decision-making engine that differentiates SalesAIGuide. However, they have an established domain and will likely outrank us initially on head terms. Focus on long-tail comparison keywords where SalesAIGuide's structured content has a quality advantage.

## 90-Day Forecast (Assumptions)
- Organic traffic begins: Week 4–6 (mid-March)
- First affiliate click (Clay): Week 4–8
- First affiliate conversion (Clay): Week 6–12
- Apollo/Instantly affiliate approved: Week 2–4 (if Matt applies this week)
- 100 monthly organic sessions: Month 2 (April)
- First $100 affiliate revenue: Month 3 (May) — assuming Clay approval and 2% conversion rate

## Next Monthly Brief
March 31, 2026 — will include first Search Console ranking data and Netlify Analytics traffic report.
