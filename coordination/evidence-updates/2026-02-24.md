## Score Review Flags
- **Gong**: Rating dropped from 4.8 → 4.7. This is a meaningful signal. Recommend reviewing Gong's Org Score (currently 78) at next monthly review. Not an automatic change — flag for Manus manual review.

## Fields Expired
All `lastVerified` fields are blank (not set in JSON). This is a data quality issue — Claude Code should add `lastVerified: "2026-02-24"` to all 10 tool JSONs in the next maintenance pass.

## Pricing Verification
- Clay: $149/mo stored — current pricing confirmed at $149/mo (Starter). ✅
- Instantly: $47/mo stored — current pricing confirmed at ~$37–47/mo range. ✅
- Apollo, Gong, HubSpot, Outreach, Salesloft, ZoomInfo: "Enterprise/custom" pricing — no stored price to verify.
- Lavender, Smartlead: Pricing not stored in JSON — add in next pass.
