# New Tool Scout Report — 2026-02-24 (Baseline)

## Summary
First-run baseline. Scanning Product Hunt, Reddit, and recent news for emerging AI sales tools worth adding to SalesAIGuide.

## Candidates This Week

| Tool | Source | Signal | Category | Already on Site? | Est. Search Volume | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nexuscale AI | Product Hunt | 50+ upvotes, "Autonomous Outbound OS" | AI SDR | No | Low (new) | Watch List |
| Saleshandy | Multiple "best cold email" lists | Appears in 5+ competitor roundups | Cold Email | No | Medium (2k+/mo) | **Build Page** |
| Lemlist | Reddit + competitor content | Frequently compared to Instantly/Smartlead | Cold Email | No | Medium (3k+/mo) | **Build Page** |
| Momentum | monday.com/blog | Listed as "AI assistant layer for CRM" | Revenue Intelligence | No | Low | Watch List |
| Cleanlist | cleanlist.ai blog | Self-published "best prospecting tools" list | Data Enrichment | No | Low (new) | Watch List |

## Recommended for Immediate Page Build
- **Saleshandy** — Appears in 5+ competitor roundup articles for "best cold email tools". High enough search volume to justify a review page. Would strengthen the cold email cluster alongside Instantly and Smartlead.
- **Lemlist** — Frequently mentioned alongside Instantly and Smartlead on Reddit and in competitor content. A Lemlist review page would unlock a "Lemlist vs Instantly" and "Lemlist vs Smartlead" comparison page.

## Watch List (Monitor 2 More Weeks)
- Nexuscale AI — New launch, low volume, unclear if it will gain traction
- Momentum — Niche use case, low search volume
- Cleanlist — Self-promotional content, unclear organic demand

## Action Required
Add Saleshandy and Lemlist to the Phase 7 tool page backlog. Brief Claude Code when ready.
